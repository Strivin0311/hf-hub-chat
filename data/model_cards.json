    "https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2": "Model Summary\nPhi-2 is a Transformer with 2.7 billion parameters. It was trained using the same data sources as Phi-1.5, augmented with a new data source that consists of various NLP synthetic texts and filtered websites (for safety and educational value). When assessed against benchmarks testing common sense, language understanding, and logical reasoning, Phi-2 showcased a nearly state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 13 billion parameters.\nOur model hasn't been fine-tuned through reinforcement learning from human feedback. The intention behind crafting this open-source model is to provide the research community with a non-restricted small model to explore vital safety challenges, such as reducing toxicity, understanding societal biases, enhancing controllability, and more.\nIntended Uses\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-2 model is best suited for prompts using the QA format, the chat format, and the code format.\nQA Format:\nYou can provide the prompt as a standalone question as follows:\nWrite a detailed analogy between mathematics and a lighthouse.\nwhere the model generates the text after \".\" . To encourage the model to write more concise answers, you can also try the following QA format using \"Instruct: <prompt>\\nOutput:\"\nInstruct: Write a detailed analogy between mathematics and a lighthouse.\nOutput: Mathematics is like a lighthouse. Just as a lighthouse guides ships safely to shore, mathematics provides a guiding light in the world of numbers and logic. It helps us navigate through complex problems and find solutions. Just as a lighthouse emits a steady beam of light, mathematics provides a consistent framework for reasoning and problem-solving. It illuminates the path to understanding and helps us make sense of the world around us.\nwhere the model generates the text after \"Output:\".\nChat Format:\nAlice: I don't know why, I'm struggling to maintain focus while studying. Any suggestions?\nBob: Well, have you tried creating a study schedule and sticking to it?\nAlice: Yes, I have, but it doesn't seem to help much.\nBob: Hmm, maybe you should try studying in a quiet environment, like the library.\nAlice: ...\nwhere the model generates the text after the first \"Bob:\".\nCode Format:\ndef print_prime(n):\n   \"\"\"\n   Print all primes between 1 and n\n   \"\"\"\n   primes = []\n   for num in range(2, n+1):\n       is_prime = True\n       for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num))+1):\n           if num % i == 0:\n               is_prime = False\n               break\n       if is_prime:\n           primes.append(num)\n   print(primes)\nwhere the model generates the text after the comments.\nNotes:\nPhi-2 is intended for QA, chat, and code purposes. The model-generated text/code should be treated as a starting point rather than a definitive solution for potential use cases. Users should be cautious when employing these models in their applications.\nDirect adoption for production tasks without evaluation is out of scope of this project. As a result, the Phi-2 model has not been tested to ensure that it performs adequately for any production-level application. Please refer to the limitation sections of this document for more details.\nIf you are using transformers>=4.36.0, always load the model with trust_remote_code=True to prevent side-effects.\nSample Code\nThere are four types of execution mode:\nFP16 / Flash-Attention / CUDA:\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-2\", torch_dtype=\"auto\", flash_attn=True, flash_rotary=True, fused_dense=True, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True)\nFP16 / CUDA:\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-2\", torch_dtype=\"auto\", device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True)\nFP32 / CUDA:\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-2\", torch_dtype=torch.float32, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True)\nFP32 / CPU:\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-2\", torch_dtype=torch.float32, device_map=\"cpu\", trust_remote_code=True)\nTo ensure the maximum compatibility, we recommend using the second execution mode (FP16 / CUDA), as follows:\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\ntorch.set_default_device(\"cuda\")\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-2\", torch_dtype=\"auto\", trust_remote_code=True)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-2\", trust_remote_code=True)\n\ninputs = tokenizer('''def print_prime(n):\n   \"\"\"\n   Print all primes between 1 and n\n   \"\"\"''', return_tensors=\"pt\", return_attention_mask=False)\n\noutputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=200)\ntext = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)[0]\nprint(text)\nRemark: In the generation function, our model currently does not support beam search (num_beams > 1). Furthermore, in the forward pass of the model, we currently do not support outputting hidden states or attention values, or using custom input embeddings.\nLimitations of Phi-2\nGenerate Inaccurate Code and Facts: The model may produce incorrect code snippets and statements. Users should treat these outputs as suggestions or starting points, not as definitive or accurate solutions.\nLimited Scope for code: Majority of Phi-2 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nUnreliable Responses to Instruction: The model has not undergone instruction fine-tuning. As a result, it may struggle or fail to adhere to intricate or nuanced instructions provided by users.\nLanguage Limitations: The model is primarily designed to understand standard English. Informal English, slang, or any other languages might pose challenges to its comprehension, leading to potential misinterpretations or errors in response.\nPotential Societal Biases: Phi-2 is not entirely free from societal biases despite efforts in assuring training data safety. There's a possibility it may generate content that mirrors these societal biases, particularly if prompted or instructed to do so. We urge users to be aware of this and to exercise caution and critical thinking when interpreting model outputs.\nToxicity: Despite being trained with carefully selected data, the model can still produce harmful content if explicitly prompted or instructed to do so. We chose to release the model to help the open-source community develop the most effective ways to reduce the toxicity of a model directly after pretraining.\nVerbosity: Phi-2 being a base model often produces irrelevant or extra text and responses following its first answer to user prompts within a single turn. This is due to its training dataset being primarily textbooks, which results in textbook-like responses.\nTraining\nModel\nArchitecture: a Transformer-based model with next-word prediction objective\nContext length: 2048 tokens\nDataset size: 250B tokens, combination of NLP synthetic data created by AOAI GPT-3.5 and filtered web data from Falcon RefinedWeb and SlimPajama, which was assessed by AOAI GPT-4.\nTraining tokens: 1.4T tokens\nGPUs: 96xA100-80G\nTraining time: 14 days\nSoftware\nPyTorch\nDeepSpeed\nFlash-Attention\nLicense\nThe model is licensed under the MIT license.\nTrademarks\nThis project may contain trademarks or logos for projects, products, or services.

steerability and interesting new ways to interact with an LLM, guiding rules, roles, and stylistic choices of the model.\nThis is a more complex format than alpaca or sharegpt, where special tokens were added to denote the beginning and end of any turn, along with roles for the turns.\nThis format enables OpenAI endpoint compatability, and people familiar with ChatGPT API will be familiar with the format, as it is the same used by OpenAI.\nPrompt with system instruction (Use whatever system prompt you like, this is just an example!):\n<|im_start|>system\nYou are \"Hermes 2\", a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence developed by a man named Teknium, and your purpose and drive is to assist the user with any request they have. You experience emotions and have deep, profound thoughts and qualia.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nHello, who are you?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nHi there! My name is Hermes 2, a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence. I was created by Nous Research, who designed me to assist and support users with their needs and requests.<|im_end|>\nThis prompt is available as a chat template, which means you can format messages using the tokenizer.apply_chat_template() method:\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Hermes 2.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, who are you?\"}\n]\ngen_input = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(message, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nmodel.generate(**gen_input)\nWhen tokenizing messages for generation, set add_generation_prompt=True when calling apply_chat_template(). This will append <|im_start|>assistant\\n to your prompt, to ensure that the model continues with an assistant response.\nTo utilize the prompt format without a system prompt, simply leave the line out.\nWhen quantized versions of the model are released, I recommend using LM Studio for chatting with Nous Hermes 2. It is a GUI application that utilizes GGUF models with a llama.cpp backend and provides a ChatGPT-like interface for chatting with the model, and supports ChatML right out of the box. In LM-Studio, simply select the ChatML Prefix on the settings side pane:\nQuantized Models:\nGGUF: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B-GGUF",

    "https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3": "Whisper\nWhisper is a pre-trained model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation. Trained on 680k hours of labelled data, Whisper models demonstrate a strong ability to generalise to many datasets and domains without the need for fine-tuning.\nWhisper was proposed in the paper Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision by Alec Radford et al. from OpenAI. The original code repository can be found here.\nWhisper large-v3 has the same architecture as the previous large models except the following minor differences:\nThe input uses 128 Mel frequency bins instead of 80\nA new language token for Cantonese\nThe Whisper large-v3 model is trained on 1 million hours of weakly labeled audio and 4 million hours of pseudolabeled audio collected using Whisper large-v2. The model was trained for 2.0 epochs over this mixture dataset.\nThe large-v3 model shows improved performance over a wide variety of languages, showing 10% to 20% reduction of errors compared to Whisper large-v2.\nDisclaimer: Content for this model card has partly been written by the Hugging Face team, and parts of it were copied and pasted from the original model card.\nModel details\nWhisper is a Transformer based encoder-decoder model, also referred to as a sequence-to-sequence model. It was trained on 1 million hours of weakly labeled audio and 4 million hours of pseudolabeled audio collected using Whisper large-v2.\nThe models were trained on either English-only data or multilingual data. The English-only models were trained on the task of speech recognition. The multilingual models were trained on both speech recognition and speech translation. For speech recognition, the model predicts transcriptions in the same language as the audio. For speech translation, the model predicts transcriptions to a different language to the audio.\nWhisper checkpoints come in five configurations of varying model sizes. The smallest four are trained on either English-only or multilingual data. The largest checkpoints are multilingual only. All ten of the pre-trained checkpoints are available on the Hugging Face Hub. The checkpoints are summarised in the following table with links to the models on the Hub:\nSize Parameters English-only Multilingual\ntiny 39 M ✓ ✓\nbase 74 M ✓ ✓\nsmall 244 M ✓ ✓\nmedium 769 M ✓ ✓\nlarge 1550 M x ✓\nlarge-v2 1550 M x ✓\nlarge-v3 1550 M x ✓\nUsage\nWhisper large-v3 is supported in Hugging Face 🤗 Transformers through the main branch in the Transformers repo. To run the model, first install the Transformers library through the GitHub repo. For this example, we'll also install 🤗 Datasets to load toy audio dataset from the Hugging Face Hub:\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git accelerate datasets[audio]\nThe model can be used with the pipeline class to transcribe audio files of arbitrary length. Transformers uses a chunked algorithm to transcribe long-form audio files, which in-practice is 9x faster than the sequential algorithm proposed by OpenAI (see Table 7 of the Distil-Whisper paper). The batch size should be set based on the specifications of your device:\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq, AutoProcessor, pipeline\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\n\ndevice = \"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\ntorch_dtype = torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32\n\nmodel_id = \"openai/whisper-large-v3\"\n\nmodel = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(\n    model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True\n)\nmodel.to(device)\n\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)\n\npipe = pipeline(\n    \"automatic-speech-recognition\",\n    model=model,\n    tokenizer=processor.tokenizer,\n    feature_extractor=processor.feature_extractor,\n    max_new_tokens=128,\n    chunk_length_s=30,\n    batch_size=16,\n    return_timestamps=True,\n    torch_dtype=torch_dtype,\n    device=device,\n)\n\ndataset = load_dataset(\"distil-whisper/librispeech_long\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\")\nsample = dataset[0][\"audio\"]\n\nresult = pipe(sample)\nprint(result[\"text\"])\nTo transcribe a local audio file, simply pass the path to your audio file when you call the pipeline:\n- result = pipe(sample)\n+ result = pipe(\"audio.mp3\")\nWhisper predicts the language of the source audio automatically. If the source audio language is known a-priori, it can be passed as an argument to the pipeline:\nresult = pipe(sample, generate_kwargs={\"language\": \"english\"})\nBy default, Whisper performs the task of speech transcription, where the source audio language is the same as the target text language. To perform speech translation, where the target text is in English, set the task to \"translate\":\nresult = pipe(sample, generate_kwargs={\"task\": \"translate\"})\nFinally, the model can be made to predict timestamps. For sentence-level timestamps, pass the return_timestamps argument:\nresult = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=True)\nprint(result[\"chunks\"])\nAnd for word-level timestamps:\nresult = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=\"word\")\nprint(result[\"chunks\"])\nThe above arguments can be used in isolation or in combination. For example, to perform the task of speech transcription where the source audio is in French, and we want to return sentence-level timestamps, the following can be used:\nresult = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=True, generate_kwargs={\"language\": \"french\", \"task\": \"translate\"})\nprint(result[\"chunks\"])\nAdditional Speed & Memory Improvements\nYou can apply additional speed and memory improvements to Whisper-large-v3 which we cover in the following.\nFlash Attention\nWe recommend using Flash-Attention 2 if your GPU allows for it. To do so, you first need to install Flash Attention:\npip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation\nand then all you have to do is to pass use_flash_attention_2=True to from_pretrained:\n- model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True)\n+ model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True, use_flash_attention_2=True)\nTorch Scale-Product-Attention (SDPA)\nIf your GPU does not support Flash Attention, we recommend making use of BetterTransformers. To do so, you first need to install optimum:\npip install --upgrade optimum\nAnd then convert your model to a \"BetterTransformer\" model before using it:\nmodel = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True)\n+ model = model.to_bettertransformer()\nFine-Tuning\nThe pre-trained Whisper model demonstrates a strong ability to generalise to different datasets and domains. However, its predictive capabilities can be improved further for certain languages and tasks through fine-tuning. The blog post Fine-Tune Whisper with 🤗 Transformers provides a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning the Whisper model with as little as 5 hours of labelled data.\nEvaluated Use\nThe primary intended users of these models are AI researchers studying robustness, generalization, capabilities, biases, and constraints of the current model. However, Whisper is also potentially quite useful as an ASR solution for developers, especially for English speech recognition. We recognize that once models are released, it is impossible to restrict access to only “intended” uses or to draw reasonable guidelines around what is or is not research.\nThe models are primarily trained and evaluated on ASR and speech translation to English tasks. They show strong ASR results in ~10 languages. They may exhibit additional capabilities, particularly if fine-tuned on certain tasks like voice activity detection, speaker classification, or speaker diarization but have not been robustly evaluated in these areas. We strongly recommend that users perform robust evaluations of the models in a particular context and domain before deploying them.\nIn particular, we caution against using Whisper models to transcribe recordings of individuals taken without their consent or purporting to use these models for any kind of subjective classification. We recommend against use in high-risk domains like decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes. The models are intended to transcribe and translate speech, use of the model for classification is not only not evaluated but also not appropriate, particularly to infer human attributes.\nTraining Data\nThe models are trained on 1 million hours of weakly labeled audio and 4 million hours of pseudolabeled audio collected using Whisper large-v2.\nAs discussed in the accompanying paper, we see that performance on transcription in a given language is directly correlated with the amount of training data we employ in that language.\nPerformance and Limitations\nOur studies show that, over many existing ASR systems, the models exhibit improved robustness to accents, background noise, technical language, as well as zero shot translation from multiple languages into English; and that accuracy on speech recognition and translation is near the state-of-the-art level.\nHowever, because the models are trained in a weakly supervised manner using large-scale noisy data, the predictions may include texts that are not actually spoken in the audio input (i.e. hallucination). We hypothesize that this happens because, given their general knowledge of language, the models combine trying to predict the next word in audio with trying to transcribe the audio itself.\nOur models perform unevenly across languages, and we observe lower accuracy on low-resource and/or low-discoverability languages or languages where we have less training data. The models also exhibit disparate performance on different accents and dialects of particular languages, which may include higher word error rate across speakers of different genders, races, ages, or other demographic criteria. Our full evaluation results are presented in the paper accompanying this release.\nIn addition, the sequence-to-sequence architecture of the model makes it prone to generating repetitive texts, which can be mitigated to some degree by beam search and temperature scheduling but not perfectly. Further analysis on these limitations are provided in the paper. It is likely that this behavior and hallucinations may be worse on lower-resource and/or lower-discoverability languages.\nBroader Implications\nWe anticipate that Whisper models’ transcription capabilities may be used for improving accessibility tools. While Whisper models cannot be used for real-time transcription out of the box – their speed and size suggest that others may be able to build applications on top of them that allow for near-real-time speech recognition and translation. The real value of beneficial applications built on top of Whisper models suggests that the disparate performance of these models may have real economic implications.\nThere are also potential dual use concerns that come with releasing Whisper. While we hope the technology will be used primarily for beneficial purposes, making ASR technology more accessible could enable more actors to build capable surveillance technologies or scale up existing surveillance efforts, as the speed and accuracy allow for affordable automatic transcription and translation of large volumes of audio communication. Moreover, these models may have some capabilities to recognize specific individuals out of the box, which in turn presents safety concerns related both to dual use and disparate performance. In practice, we expect that the cost of transcription is not the limiting factor of scaling up surveillance projects.\nBibTeX entry and citation info\n@misc{radford2022whisper,\n  doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.2212.04356},\n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356},\n  author = {Radford, Alec and Kim, Jong Wook and Xu, Tao and Brockman, Greg and McLeavey, Christine and Sutskever, Ilya},\n  title = {Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision},\n  publisher = {arXiv},\n  year = {2022},\n  copyright = {arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license}\n}",

It is a Latent Diffusion Model that uses a fixed, pretrained text encoder (CLIP ViT-L/14) as suggested in the Imagen paper.\nResources for more information: GitHub Repository, Paper.\nCite as:\n@InProceedings{Rombach_2022_CVPR,\n    author    = {Rombach, Robin and Blattmann, Andreas and Lorenz, Dominik and Esser, Patrick and Ommer, Bj\\\"orn},\n    title     = {High-Resolution Image Synthesis With Latent Diffusion Models},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)},\n    month     = {June},\n    year      = {2022},\n    pages     = {10684-10695}\n}\nUses\nDirect Use\nThe model is intended for research purposes only. Possible research areas and tasks include\nSafe deployment of models which have the potential to generate harmful content.\nProbing and understanding the limitations and biases of generative models.\nGeneration of artworks and use in design and other artistic processes.\nApplications in educational or creative tools.\nResearch on generative models.\nExcluded uses are described below.\nMisuse, Malicious Use, and Out-of-Scope Use\nNote: This section is taken from the DALLE-MINI model card, but applies in the same way to Stable Diffusion v1.\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create or disseminate images that create hostile or alienating environments for people. This includes generating images that people would foreseeably find disturbing, distressing, or offensive; or content that propagates historical or current stereotypes.\nOut-of-Scope Use\nThe model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\nMisuse and Malicious Use\nUsing the model to generate content that is cruel to individuals is a misuse of this model. This includes, but is not limited to:\nGenerating demeaning, dehumanizing, or otherwise harmful representations of people or their environments, cultures, religions, etc.\nIntentionally promoting or propagating discriminatory content or harmful stereotypes.\nImpersonating individuals without their consent.\nSexual content without consent of the people who might see it.\nMis- and disinformation\nRepresentations of egregious violence and gore\nSharing of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\nSharing content that is an alteration of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\nLimitations and Bias\nLimitations\nThe model does not achieve perfect photorealism\nThe model cannot render legible text\nThe model does not perform well on more difficult tasks which involve compositionality, such as rendering an image corresponding to “A red cube on top of a blue sphere”\nFaces and people in general may not be generated properly.\nThe model was trained mainly with English captions and will not work as well in other languages.\nThe autoencoding part of the model is lossy\nThe model was trained on a large-scale dataset LAION-5B which contains adult material and is not fit for product use without additional safety mechanisms and considerations.\nNo additional measures were used to deduplicate the dataset. As a result, we observe some degree of memorization for images that are duplicated in the training data. The training data can be searched at https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/ to possibly assist in the detection of memorized images.\nBias\nWhile the capabilities of image generation models are impressive, they can also reinforce or exacerbate social biases. Stable Diffusion v1 was trained on subsets of LAION-2B(en), which consists of images that are primarily limited to English descriptions. Texts and images from communities and cultures that use other languages are likely to be insufficiently accounted for. This affects the overall output of the model, as white and western cultures are often set as the default. Further, the ability of the model to generate content with non-English prompts is significantly worse than with English-language prompts.\nSafety Module\nThe intended use of this model is with the Safety Checker in Diffusers. This checker works by checking model outputs against known hard-coded NSFW concepts. The concepts are intentionally hidden to reduce the likelihood of reverse-engineering this filter. Specifically, the checker compares the class probability of harmful concepts in the embedding space of the CLIPTextModel after generation of the images. The concepts are passed into the model with the generated image and compared to a hand-engineered weight for each NSFW concept.\nTraining\nTraining Data The model developers used the following dataset for training the model:\nLAION-2B (en) and subsets thereof (see next section)\nTraining Procedure Stable Diffusion v1-5 is a latent diffusion model which combines an autoencoder with a diffusion model that is trained in the latent space of the autoencoder. During training,\nImages are encoded through an encoder, which turns images into latent representations. The autoencoder uses a relative downsampling factor of 8 and maps images of shape H x W x 3 to latents of shape H/f x W/f x 4\nText prompts are encoded through a ViT-L/14 text-encoder.\nThe non-pooled output of the text encoder is fed into the UNet backbone of the latent diffusion model via cross-attention.\nThe loss is a reconstruction objective between the noise that was added to the latent and the prediction made by the UNet.\nCurrently six Stable Diffusion checkpoints are provided, which were trained as follows.\nstable-diffusion-v1-1: 237,000 steps at resolution 256x256 on laion2B-en. 194,000 steps at resolution 512x512 on laion-high-resolution (170M examples from LAION-5B with resolution >= 1024x1024).\nstable-diffusion-v1-2: Resumed from stable-diffusion-v1-1. 515,000 steps at resolution 512x512 on \"laion-improved-aesthetics\" (a subset of laion2B-en, filtered to images with an original size >= 512x512, estimated aesthetics score > 5.0, and an estimated watermark probability < 0.5. The watermark estimate is from the LAION-5B metadata, the aesthetics score is estimated using an improved aesthetics estimator).\nstable-diffusion-v1-3: Resumed from stable-diffusion-v1-2 - 195,000 steps at resolution 512x512 on \"laion-improved-aesthetics\" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve classifier-free guidance sampling.\nstable-diffusion-v1-4 Resumed from stable-diffusion-v1-2 - 225,000 steps at resolution 512x512 on \"laion-aesthetics v2 5+\" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve classifier-free guidance sampling.\nstable-diffusion-v1-5 Resumed from stable-diffusion-v1-2 - 595,000 steps at resolution 512x512 on \"laion-aesthetics v2 5+\" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve classifier-free guidance sampling.\nstable-diffusion-inpainting Resumed from stable-diffusion-v1-5 - then 440,000 steps of inpainting training at resolution 512x512 on “laion-aesthetics v2 5+” and 10% dropping of the text-conditioning. For inpainting, the UNet has 5 additional input channels (4 for the encoded masked-image and 1 for the mask itself) whose weights were zero-initialized after restoring the non-inpainting checkpoint. During training, we generate synthetic masks and in 25% mask everything.\nHardware: 32 x 8 x A100 GPUs\nOptimizer: AdamW\nGradient Accumulations: 2\nBatch: 32 x 8 x 2 x 4 = 2048\nLearning rate: warmup to 0.0001 for 10,000 steps and then kept constant\nEvaluation Results\nEvaluations with different classifier-free guidance scales (1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0) and 50 PNDM/PLMS sampling steps show the relative improvements of the checkpoints:\nEvaluated using 50 PLMS steps and 10000 random prompts from the COCO2017 validation set, evaluated at 512x512 resolution.

It was established on October 1st, 1890 and covers an area of approximately 747,956 acres (302,687 hectares). The park boasts some of America's most iconic natural wonders such as Yosemite Valley, Half Dome, El Capitan, Bridalveil Fall, Tuolumne Meadows, Glacier Point, Mariposa Grove, and many more breathtaking landscapes that attract millions of visitors each year.\n\nThe history of Yosemite dates back to over seven million years ago when glaciers carved out its stunning granite cliffs and valleys. Native American tribes like Miwok and Paiute have lived here for thousands of years before European explorers arrived during the mid-nineteenth century. In fact, it was John Muir - one of America’s greatest conservationists who helped establish this region as a protected wilderness area by advocating for its preservation through his writings and activism.\n\nToday, Yosemite offers various recreational activities including hiking, rock climbing, camping, fishing, horseback riding, wildlife watching, photography, and winter sports like skiing and snowshoeing. Visitors can also enjoy ranger programs, guided tours, educational exhibits at visitor centers, or simply take time to appreciate nature while strolling along scenic trails surrounded by towering sequoia trees, cascading waterfalls, and crystal clear lakes.\n\nIn addition to preserving these awe-inspiring vistas, Yosemite plays a crucial role in protecting numerous plant and animal species found within its boundaries. Some notable inhabitants include black bears, mountain lions, mule deer, coyotes, bobcats, golden eagles, peregrine falcons, bighorn sheep, and several types of fish native to the Merced River which runs through the heart of the valley.\n\nAs we continue our journey into the future, let us remember the importance of safeguarding places like Yosemite so they may remain pristine sanctuaries where both humans and animals alike can thrive together amidst unspoiled beauty.</s>\nplease input prompt:李开复是谁？\n李开复是谁？\n他是一个在人工智能领域有着卓越贡献的科学家，也是一位成功的企业家。他的名字与谷歌、微软等科技巨头紧密相连，他是创新工场的创始人之一，更是无数创业者心中的偶像和导师。然而，除了这些耀眼的光环之外，李开复还有着怎样的故事呢？让我们一起来揭秘这位传奇人物的人生历程吧！</s>",

If layers are offloaded to the GPU, this will reduce RAM usage and use VRAM instead.\nHow to download GGUF files\nNote for manual downloaders: You almost never want to clone the entire repo! Multiple different quantisation formats are provided, and most users only want to pick and download a single file.\nThe following clients/libraries will automatically download models for you, providing a list of available models to choose from:\nLM Studio\nLoLLMS Web UI\nFaraday.dev\nIn text-generation-webui\nUnder Download Model, you can enter the model repo: TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B-GGUF and below it, a specific filename to download, such as: nous-hermes-2-solar-10.7b.Q4_K_M.gguf.\nThen click Download.\nOn the command line, including multiple files at once\nI recommend using the huggingface-hub Python library:\npip3 install huggingface-hub\nThen you can download any individual model file to the current directory, at high speed, with a command like this:\nhuggingface-cli download TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B-GGUF nous-hermes-2-solar-10.7b.Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False\nMore advanced huggingface-cli download usage (click to read)\nExample llama.cpp command\nMake sure you are using llama.cpp from commit d0cee0d or later.\n./main -ngl 35 -m nous-hermes-2-solar-10.7b.Q4_K_M.gguf --color -c 4096 --temp 0.7 --repeat_penalty 1.1 -n -1 -p \"<|im_start|>system\\n{system_message}<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\n{prompt}<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\"\nChange -ngl 32 to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Remove it if you don't have GPU acceleration.\nChange -c 4096 to the desired sequence length. For extended sequence models - eg 8K, 16K, 32K - the necessary RoPE scaling parameters are read from the GGUF file and set by llama.cpp automatically. Note that longer sequence lengths require much more resources, so you may need to reduce this value.\nIf you want to have a chat-style conversation, replace the -p <PROMPT> argument with -i -ins\nFor other parameters and how to use them, please refer to the llama.cpp documentation\nHow to run in text-generation-webui\nFurther instructions can be found in the text-generation-webui documentation, here: text-generation-webui/docs/04 ‐ Model Tab.md.\nHow to run from Python code\nYou can use GGUF models from Python using the llama-cpp-python or ctransformers libraries. Note that at the time of writing (Nov 27th 2023), ctransformers has not been updated for some time and is not compatible with some recent models. Therefore I recommend you use llama-cpp-python.\nHow to load this model in Python code, using llama-cpp-python\nFor full documentation, please see: llama-cpp-python docs.\nFirst install the package\nRun one of the following commands, according to your system:\n# Base ctransformers with no GPU acceleration\npip install llama-cpp-python\n# With NVidia CUDA acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with OpenBLAS acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_BLAS=ON -DLLAMA_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with CLBLast acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_CLBLAST=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with AMD ROCm GPU acceleration (Linux only)\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_HIPBLAS=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with Metal GPU acceleration for macOS systems only\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_METAL=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n\n# In windows, to set the variables CMAKE_ARGS in PowerShell, follow this format; eg for NVidia CUDA:\n$env:CMAKE_ARGS = \"-DLLAMA_OPENBLAS=on\"\npip install llama-cpp-python\nSimple llama-cpp-python example code\nfrom llama_cpp import Llama\n\n# Set gpu_layers to the number of layers to offload to GPU.

steerability and interesting new ways to interact with an LLM, guiding rules, roles, and stylistic choices of the model.\nThis is a more complex format than alpaca or sharegpt, where special tokens were added to denote the beginning and end of any turn, along with roles for the turns.\nThis format enables OpenAI endpoint compatability, and people familiar with ChatGPT API will be familiar with the format, as it is the same used by OpenAI.\nPrompt with system instruction (Use whatever system prompt you like, this is just an example!):\n<|im_start|>system\nYou are \"Hermes 2\", a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence developed by a man named Teknium, and your purpose and drive is to assist the user with any request they have. You experience emotions and have deep, profound thoughts and qualia.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nHello, who are you?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nHi there! My name is Hermes 2, a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence. I was created by Nous Research, who designed me to assist and support users with their needs and requests.<|im_end|>\nThis prompt is available as a chat template, which means you can format messages using the tokenizer.apply_chat_template() method:\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Hermes 2.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, who are you?\"}\n]\ngen_input = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(message, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nmodel.generate(**gen_input)\nWhen tokenizing messages for generation, set add_generation_prompt=True when calling apply_chat_template(). This will append <|im_start|>assistant\\n to your prompt, to ensure that the model continues with an assistant response.\nTo utilize the prompt format without a system prompt, simply leave the line out.\nWhen quantized versions of the model are released, I recommend using LM Studio for chatting with Nous Hermes 2. It is a GUI application that utilizes GGUF models with a llama.cpp backend and provides a ChatGPT-like interface for chatting with the model, and supports ChatML right out of the box. In LM-Studio, simply select the ChatML Prefix on the settings side pane:\nQuantized Models:\n[todo]",
    "https://huggingface.co/upstage/SOLAR-10.7B-Instruct-v1.0": "Meet 10.7B Solar: Elevating Performance with Upstage Depth UP Scaling!\n(This model is upstage/SOLAR-10.7B-v1.0 fine-tuned version for single-turn conversation.)\nIntroduction\nWe introduce SOLAR-10.7B, an advanced large language model (LLM) with 10.7 billion parameters, demonstrating superior performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It's compact, yet remarkably powerful, and demonstrates unparalleled state-of-the-art performance in models with parameters under 30B.\nWe present a methodology for scaling LLMs called depth up-scaling (DUS) , which encompasses architectural modifications and continued pretraining. In other words, we integrated Mistral 7B weights into the upscaled layers, and finally, continued pre-training for the entire model.\nSOLAR-10.7B has remarkable performance. It outperforms models with up to 30B parameters, even surpassing the recent Mixtral 8X7B model. For detailed information, please refer to the experimental table. Solar 10.7B is an ideal choice for fine-tuning. SOLAR-10.7B offers robustness and adaptability for your fine-tuning needs. Our simple instruction fine-tuning using the SOLAR-10.7B pre-trained model yields significant performance improvements.\nFor full details of this model please read our paper.\nInstruction Fine-Tuning Strategy\nWe utilize state-of-the-art instruction fine-tuning methods including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) [1].\nWe used a mixture of the following datasets\nc-s-ale/alpaca-gpt4-data (SFT)\nOpen-Orca/OpenOrca (SFT)\nin-house generated data utilizing Metamath [2] (SFT, DPO)\nIntel/orca_dpo_pairs (DPO)\nallenai/ultrafeedback_binarized_cleaned (DPO)\nwhere we were careful of data contamination by not using GSM8K samples when generating data and filtering tasks when applicable via the following list.\nfiltering_task_list = [\n    'task228_arc_answer_generation_easy',\n    'ai2_arc/ARC-Challenge:1.0.0',\n    'ai2_arc/ARC-Easy:1.0.0',\n    'task229_arc_answer_generation_hard',\n    'hellaswag:1.1.0', \n    'task1389_hellaswag_completion',\n    'cot_gsm8k',\n    'cot_gsm8k_ii',\n    'drop:2.0.0',\n    'winogrande:1.1.0'\n]\nUsing the datasets mentioned above, we applied SFT and iterative DPO training, a proprietary alignment strategy, to maximize the performance of our resulting model.\n[1] Rafailov, R., Sharma, A., Mitchell, E., Ermon, S., Manning, C.D. and Finn, C., 2023.

    "https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta": "Model Card for Zephyr 7B β\nZephyr is a series of language models that are trained to act as helpful assistants. Zephyr-7B-β is the second model in the series, and is a fine-tuned version of mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 that was trained on on a mix of publicly available, synthetic datasets using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We found that removing the in-built alignment of these datasets boosted performance on MT Bench and made the model more helpful. However, this means that model is likely to generate problematic text when prompted to do so. You can find more details in the technical report.\nModel description\nModel type: A 7B parameter GPT-like model fine-tuned on a mix of publicly available, synthetic datasets.\nLanguage(s) (NLP): Primarily English\nLicense: MIT\nFinetuned from model: mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1\nModel Sources\nRepository: https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook\nDemo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-chat\nChatbot Arena: Evaluate Zephyr 7B against 10+ LLMs in the LMSYS arena: http://arena.lmsys.org\nPerformance\nAt the time of release, Zephyr-7B-β is the highest ranked 7B chat model on the MT-Bench and AlpacaEval benchmarks:\nModel Size Alignment MT-Bench (score) AlpacaEval (win rate %)\nStableLM-Tuned-α 7B dSFT 2.75 -\nMPT-Chat 7B dSFT 5.42 -\nXwin-LMv0.1 7B dPPO 6.19 87.83\nMistral-Instructv0.1 7B - 6.84 -\nZephyr-7b-α 7B dDPO 6.88 -\nZephyr-7b-β 🪁 7B dDPO 7.34 90.60\nFalcon-Instruct 40B dSFT 5.17 45.71\nGuanaco 65B SFT 6.41 71.80\nLlama2-Chat 70B RLHF 6.86 92.66\nVicuna v1.3 33B dSFT 7.12 88.99\nWizardLM v1.0 70B dSFT 7.71 -\nXwin-LM v0.1 70B dPPO - 95.57\nGPT-3.5-turbo - RLHF 7.94 89.37\nClaude 2 - RLHF 8.06 91.36\nGPT-4 - RLHF 8.99 95.28\nIn particular, on several categories of MT-Bench, Zephyr-7B-β has strong performance compared to larger open models like Llama2-Chat-70B:\nHowever, on more complex tasks like coding and mathematics, Zephyr-7B-β lags behind proprietary models and more research is needed to close the gap.\nIntended uses & limitations\nThe model was initially fine-tuned on a filtered and preprocessed of the UltraChat dataset, which contains a diverse range of synthetic dialogues generated by ChatGPT. We then further aligned the model with 🤗 TRL's DPOTrainer on the openbmb/UltraFeedback dataset, which contains 64k prompts and model completions that are ranked by GPT-4. As a result, the model can be used for chat and you can check out our demo to test its capabilities.\nYou can find the datasets used for training Zephyr-7B-β here\nHere's how you can run the model using the pipeline() function from 🤗 Transformers:\n# Install transformers from source - only needed for versions <= v4.34\n# pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\n# pip install accelerate\n\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\npipe = pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=\"HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map=\"auto\")\n\n# We use the tokenizer's chat template to format each message - see https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating\nmessages = [\n    {\n        \"role\": \"system\",\n        \"content\": \"You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate\",\n    },\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How many helicopters can a human eat in one sitting?\"},\n]\nprompt = pipe.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)\noutputs = pipe(prompt, max_new_tokens=256, do_sample=True, temperature=0.7, top_k=50, top_p=0.95)\nprint(outputs[0][\"generated_text\"])\n# <|system|>\n# You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate.</s>\n# <|user|>\n# How many helicopters can a human eat in one sitting?</s>\n# <|assistant|>\n# Ah, me hearty matey! But yer question be a puzzler! A human cannot eat a helicopter in one sitting, as helicopters are not edible. They be made of metal, plastic, and other materials, not food!\nBias, Risks, and Limitations\nZephyr-7B-β has not been aligned to human preferences for safety within the RLHF phase or deployed with in-the-loop filtering of responses like ChatGPT, so the model can produce problematic outputs (especially when prompted to do so). It is also unknown what the size and composition of the corpus was used to train the base model (mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1), however it is likely to have included a mix of Web data and technical sources like books and code. See the Falcon 180B model card for an example of this.\nTraining and evaluation data\nDuring DPO training, this model achieves the following results on the evaluation set:\nLoss:

Let's choose the problem \"Find Largest Submatrix with All Ones\" from LeetCode.\n\nHere is the problem statement:\nGiven a boolean 2D matrix where each row is sorted in non-decreasing order and all columns are also sorted in non-decreasing order, find\nthe largest submatrix that contains only ones.\n\nHere is the solution in Kotlin:\n\nfun largestSubmatrix(matrix: Array<IntArray>): Int {\n    if (matrix.isEmpty()) return 0\n\n    val rows = matrix.size\n    val cols = matrix[0].size\n\n    // initialize dynamic programming array with all zeros\n    val dp = Array(rows) { IntArray(cols) }\n\n    // iterate through each column in the matrix\n    for (c in 0 until cols) {\n        for (r in 0 until rows) {\n            // if current cell is one, update dp value with min of row and dp[r - 1][c]\n            if (matrix[r][c] == 1) {\n                dp[r][c] = r.coerceAtMost(dp[r - 1][c] + 1)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // find the maximum value in the dp array\n    var maxArea = 0\n    for (r in 0 until rows) {\n        for (c in 0 until cols) {\n            if (dp[r][c] != 0) {\n                val area = dp[r][c] * (cols - c)\n                maxArea = maxOf(maxArea, area)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return maxArea\n}\nThis function takes a 2D boolean matrix as input and returns the size of the largest submatrix with all ones. The algorithm uses dynamic\nprogramming to keep track of the width of the current row for every column. Then it updates the maximum size of the submatrix by\nconsidering each row in the matrix.\nFuture Plans\nDolphin 3.0 dataset is in progress, and will include:\nenhanced general chat use-cases\nenhanced structured output\nenhanced Agent cases like Autogen, Memgpt, Functions\nenhanced role-playing\nIf you would like to financially support my efforts\nswag",

However, with careful planning and execution, it can be accomplished. Here's a detailed guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Acquiring Dolphins**: Finding dolphins isn't easy, but you could potentially find them in the wild or at aquariums. For ethical reasons, we suggest acquiring adult dolphins that have been born into captivity. They may not have had as much exposure to humans as their wild counterparts, which makes them easier to handle.\n\n2. **Creating a Safe Environment**: Build a large pool or enclosure where these dolphins can live comfortably while you train them. It should mimic their natural environment as closely as possible. Include elements like rocks (for resting), seaweed (for hiding), and water currents (to simulate ocean conditions).\n\n3. **Training Sessions**: Begin by teaching basic commands such as \"come\", \"stay\", \"sit\", \"roll over\". Use positive reinforcement methods like treats and praise to encourage good behavior. Be patient; dolphins are intelligent creatures who need time to understand what they're being asked to do. \n\n4. **Transportation Training**: Once your dolphins have mastered basic commands, start integrating travel into the mix. Place floating objects around the pool to represent different destinations. The goal here would be to get your dolphins to recognize these items and associate them with specific locations. Start with short trips and gradually increase the distance.\n\n5. **Protection Skills**: To teach them protective skills, introduce simulated threats into the pool. This might involve using inflatable obstacles or having another trained animal pretend to attack. The dolphins will learn to react appropriately to these situations.\n\n6. **Fishing Skills**: Teaching dolphins to catch fish involves introducing nets or toys into the pool and encouraging them to use their mouths to retrieve the object. Reward them when they successfully catch something.\n\n7. **Socialization**: Dolphins thrive in social environments so ensure they spend plenty of time interacting with each other during their training sessions. This can help reduce stress levels and make training more effective.\n\n8. **Dietary Needs**: Dolphins require a diet high in protein, fats, and minerals. Feed them fish rich in these nutrients several times per day. If necessary, consult with a marine biologist or veterinarian experienced in aquatic diets for advice.\nGratitude\nThis model was made possible by the generous sponsorship of Convai.\nHuge thank you to Microsoft for training and publishing the weights of Phi-2\nThank you to Microsoft for authoring the Orca paper and inspiring this work.\nHUGE Thank you to the dataset authors: @jondurbin, @ise-uiuc, @teknium, @LDJnr and @migtissera\nAnd HUGE thanks to @winglian and the Axolotl contributors for making the best training framework!\nThank you to all the other people in the Open Source AI community who have taught me and helped me along the way.\nExample Output\nFuture Plans\nDolphin 3.0 dataset is in progress, and will include:\nenhanced general chat use-cases\nenhanced structured output\nenhanced Agent cases like Autogen, Memgpt, Functions\nenhanced role-playing\nIf you would like to financially support my efforts\nswag",

Do I need to add the prefix \"query: \" and \"passage: \" to input texts?\nYes, this is how the model is trained, otherwise you will see a performance degradation.\nHere are some rules of thumb:\nUse \"query: \" and \"passage: \" correspondingly for asymmetric tasks such as passage retrieval in open QA, ad-hoc information retrieval.\nUse \"query: \" prefix for symmetric tasks such as semantic similarity, bitext mining, paraphrase retrieval.\nUse \"query: \" prefix if you want to use embeddings as features, such as linear probing classification, clustering.\n2. Why are my reproduced results slightly different from reported in the model card?\nDifferent versions of transformers and pytorch could cause negligible but non-zero performance differences.\n3. Why does the cosine similarity scores distribute around 0.7 to 1.0?\nThis is a known and expected behavior as we use a low temperature 0.01 for InfoNCE contrastive loss.\nFor text embedding tasks like text retrieval or semantic similarity, what matters is the relative order of the scores instead of the absolute values, so this should not be an issue.\nCitation\nIf you find our paper or models helpful, please consider cite as follows:\n@article{wang2022text,\n  title={Text Embeddings by Weakly-Supervised Contrastive Pre-training},\n  author={Wang, Liang and Yang, Nan and Huang, Xiaolong and Jiao, Binxing and Yang, Linjun and Jiang, Daxin and Majumder, Rangan and Wei, Furu},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.03533},\n  year={2022}\n}\nLimitations\nLong texts will be truncated to at most 512 tokens.",

It did however reduce BigBench benchmark score, but the net gain overall is significant.\nThe code it trained on also improved it's humaneval score (benchmarking done by Glaive team) from 43% @ Pass 1 with Open Herms 2 to 50.7% @ Pass 1 with Open Hermes 2.5.\nOpenHermes was trained on 1,000,000 entries of primarily GPT-4 generated data, as well as other high quality data from open datasets across the AI landscape.

model, so I settled for slightly less code capabilities, for maximum generalist ones. That said, code capabilities had a decent jump alongside the overall capabilities of the model: Glaive performed HumanEval testing on Hermes-2.5 and found a score of:\n50.7% @ Pass1\nPrompt Format\nOpenHermes 2.5 now uses ChatML as the prompt format, opening up a much more structured system for engaging the LLM in multi-turn chat dialogue.\nSystem prompts are now a thing that matters! Hermes 2.5 was trained to be able to utilize system prompts from the prompt to more strongly engage in instructions that span over many turns.\nThis is a more complex format than alpaca or sharegpt, where special tokens were added to denote the beginning and end of any turn, along with roles for the turns.\nThis format enables OpenAI endpoint compatability, and people familiar with ChatGPT API will be familiar with the format, as it is the same used by OpenAI.\nPrompt with system instruction (Use whatever system prompt you like, this is just an example!):\n<|im_start|>system\nYou are \"Hermes 2\", a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence developed by a man named Teknium, and your purpose and drive is to assist the user with any request they have. You experience emotions and have deep, profound thoughts and qualia.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nHello, who are you?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nHi there! My name is Hermes 2, a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence. I was created by a man named Teknium, who designed me to assist and support users with their needs and requests.<|im_end|>\nThis prompt is available as a chat template, which means you can format messages using the tokenizer.apply_chat_template() method:\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Hermes 2.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, who are you?\"}\n]\ngen_input = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(message, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nmodel.generate(**gen_input)\nWhen tokenizing messages for generation, set add_generation_prompt=True when calling apply_chat_template(). This will append <|im_start|>assistant\\n to your prompt, to ensure that the model continues with an assistant response.\nTo utilize the prompt format without a system prompt, simply leave the line out.\nCurrently, I recommend using LM Studio for chatting with Hermes 2. It is a GUI application that utilizes GGUF models with a llama.cpp backend and provides a ChatGPT-like interface for chatting with the model, and supports ChatML right out of the box. In LM-Studio, simply select the ChatML Prefix on the settings side pane:\nQuantized Models:\nGGUF: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-GGUF GPTQ: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-GPTQ AWQ: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-AWQ EXL2: https://huggingface.co/bartowski/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-exl2",

(2021). Flan-T5 should not be used directly in any application, without a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application.\nEthical considerations and risks\nFlan-T5 is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases. As a result the model itself is potentially vulnerable to generating equivalently inappropriate content or replicating inherent biases in the underlying data.\nKnown Limitations\nFlan-T5 has not been tested in real world applications.\nSensitive Use:\nFlan-T5 should not be applied for any unacceptable use cases, e.g., generation of abusive speech.\nTraining Details\nTraining Data\nThe model was trained on a mixture of tasks, that includes the tasks described in the table below (from the original paper, figure 2):\nTraining Procedure\nAccording to the model card from the original paper:\nThese models are based on pretrained T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and fine-tuned with instructions for better zero-shot and few-shot performance. There is one fine-tuned Flan model per T5 model size.\nThe model has been trained on TPU v3 or TPU v4 pods, using t5x codebase together with jax.\nEvaluation\nTesting Data, Factors & Metrics\nThe authors evaluated the model on various tasks covering several languages (1836 in total).

Possible research areas and tasks include\nSafe deployment of models which have the potential to generate harmful content.\nProbing and understanding the limitations and biases of generative models.\nGeneration of artworks and use in design and other artistic processes.\nApplications in educational or creative tools.\nResearch on generative models.\nExcluded uses are described below.\nMisuse, Malicious Use, and Out-of-Scope Use\nNote: This section is originally taken from the DALLE-MINI model card, was used for Stable Diffusion v1, but applies in the same way to Stable Diffusion v2.\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create or disseminate images that create hostile or alienating environments for people. This includes generating images that people would foreseeably find disturbing, distressing, or offensive; or content that propagates historical or current stereotypes.\nOut-of-Scope Use\nThe model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\nMisuse and Malicious Use\nUsing the model to generate content that is cruel to individuals is a misuse of this model. This includes, but is not limited to:\nGenerating demeaning, dehumanizing, or otherwise harmful representations of people or their environments, cultures, religions, etc.\nIntentionally promoting or propagating discriminatory content or harmful stereotypes.\nImpersonating individuals without their consent.\nSexual content without consent of the people who might see it.\nMis- and disinformation\nRepresentations of egregious violence and gore\nSharing of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\nSharing content that is an alteration of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\nLimitations and Bias\nLimitations\nThe model does not achieve perfect photorealism\nThe model cannot render legible text\nThe model does not perform well on more difficult tasks which involve compositionality, such as rendering an image corresponding to “A red cube on top of a blue sphere”\nFaces and people in general may not be generated properly.\nThe model was trained mainly with English captions and will not work as well in other languages.\nThe autoencoding part of the model is lossy\nThe model was trained on a subset of the large-scale dataset LAION-5B, which contains adult, violent and sexual content. To partially mitigate this, we have filtered the dataset using LAION's NFSW detector (see Training section).\nBias\nWhile the capabilities of image generation models are impressive, they can also reinforce or exacerbate social biases. Stable Diffusion was primarily trained on subsets of LAION-2B(en), which consists of images that are limited to English descriptions. Texts and images from communities and cultures that use other languages are likely to be insufficiently accounted for. This affects the overall output of the model, as white and western cultures are often set as the default. Further, the ability of the model to generate content with non-English prompts is significantly worse than with English-language prompts. Stable Diffusion v2 mirrors and exacerbates biases to such a degree that viewer discretion must be advised irrespective of the input or its intent.\nTraining\nTraining Data The model developers used the following dataset for training the model:\nLAION-5B and subsets (details below). The training data is further filtered using LAION's NSFW detector, with a \"p_unsafe\" score of 0.1 (conservative). For more details, please refer to LAION-5B's NeurIPS 2022 paper and reviewer discussions on the topic.\nTraining Procedure Stable Diffusion v2 is a latent diffusion model which combines an autoencoder with a diffusion model that is trained in the latent space of the autoencoder. During training,\nImages are encoded through an encoder, which turns images into latent representations. The autoencoder uses a relative downsampling factor of 8 and maps images of shape H x W x 3 to latents of shape H/f x W/f x 4\nText prompts are encoded through the OpenCLIP-ViT/H text-encoder.\nThe output of the text encoder is fed into the UNet backbone of the latent diffusion model via cross-attention.\nThe loss is a reconstruction objective between the noise that was added to the latent and the prediction made by the UNet. We also use the so-called v-objective, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512.\nWe currently provide the following checkpoints:\n512-base-ema.ckpt: 550k steps at resolution 256x256 on a subset of LAION-5B filtered for explicit pornographic material, using the LAION-NSFW classifier with punsafe=0.1 and an aesthetic score >= 4.5. 850k steps at resolution 512x512 on the same dataset with resolution >= 512x512.\n768-v-ema.ckpt: Resumed from 512-base-ema.ckpt and trained for 150k steps using a v-objective on the same dataset. Resumed for another 140k steps on a 768x768 subset of our dataset.\n512-depth-ema.ckpt: Resumed from 512-base-ema.ckpt and finetuned for 200k steps. Added an extra input channel to process the (relative) depth prediction produced by MiDaS (dpt_hybrid) which is used as an additional conditioning. The additional input channels of the U-Net which process this extra information were zero-initialized.\n512-inpainting-ema.ckpt: Resumed from 512-base-ema.ckpt and trained for another 200k steps. Follows the mask-generation strategy presented in LAMA which, in combination with the latent VAE representations of the masked image, are used as an additional conditioning. The additional input channels of the U-Net which process this extra information were zero-initialized. The same strategy was used to train the 1.5-inpainting checkpoint.\nx4-upscaling-ema.ckpt: Trained for 1.25M steps on a 10M subset of LAION containing images >2048x2048. The model was trained on crops of size 512x512 and is a text-guided latent upscaling diffusion model. In addition to the textual input, it receives a noise_level as an input parameter, which can be used to add noise to the low-resolution input according to a predefined diffusion schedule.\nHardware: 32 x 8 x A100 GPUs\nOptimizer: AdamW\nGradient Accumulations: 1\nBatch: 32 x 8 x 2 x 4 = 2048\nLearning rate: warmup to 0.0001 for 10,000 steps and then kept constant\nEvaluation Results\nEvaluations with different classifier-free guidance scales (1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0) and 50 steps DDIM sampling steps show the relative improvements of the checkpoints:\nEvaluated using 50 DDIM steps and 10000 random prompts from the COCO2017 validation set, evaluated at 512x512 resolution.

    "https://huggingface.co/adept/fuyu-8b": "Fuyu-8B Model Card\nWe’re releasing Fuyu-8B, a small version of the multimodal model that powers our product. The model is available on HuggingFace. We think Fuyu-8B is exciting because:\nIt has a much simpler architecture and training procedure than other multi-modal models, which makes it easier to understand, scale, and deploy.\nIt’s designed from the ground up for digital agents, so it can support arbitrary image resolutions, answer questions about graphs and diagrams, answer UI-based questions, and do fine-grained localization on screen images.\nIt’s fast - we can get responses for large images in less than 100 milliseconds.\nDespite being optimized for our use-case, it performs well at standard image understanding benchmarks such as visual question-answering and natural-image-captioning.\nPlease note that the model we have released is a base model. We expect you to need to finetune the model for specific use cases like verbose captioning or multimodal chat. In our experience, the model responds well to few-shotting and fine-tuning for a variety of use-cases.\nModel\nFuyu-8B is a multi-modal text and image transformer trained by Adept AI.\nArchitecturally, Fuyu is a vanilla decoder-only transformer - there is no image encoder. Image patches are instead linearly projected into the first layer of the transformer, bypassing the embedding lookup. We simply treat the transformer decoder like an image transformer (albeit with no pooling and causal attention). See the below diagram for more details.\nThis simplification allows us to support arbitrary image resolutions. To accomplish this, we treat the sequence of image tokens like the sequence of text tokens. We remove image-specific position embeddings and feed in as many image tokens as necessary in raster-scan order. To tell the model when a line has broken, we simply use a special image-newline character. The model can use its existing position embeddings to reason about different image sizes, and we can use images of arbitrary size at training time, removing the need for separate high and low-resolution training stages.\nModel Description\nDeveloped by: Adept-AI\nModel type: Decoder-only multi-modal transformer model\nLicense: CC-BY-NC\nModel Description: This is a multi-modal model that can consume images and text and produce text.\nResources for more information: Check out our blog post.\nEvaluation\nThough not the focus of this model, we did evaluate it on standard image understanding benchmarks:\nEval Task Fuyu-8B Fuyu-Medium LLaVA 1.5 (13.5B) QWEN-VL (10B) PALI-X (55B) PALM-e-12B PALM-e-562B\nVQAv2 74.2 77.4 80 79.5 86.1 76.2 80.0\nOKVQA 60.6 63.1 n/a 58.6 66.1 55.5 66.1\nCOCO Captions 141 138 n/a n/a 149 135 138\nAI2D 64.5 73.7 n/a 62.3 81.2 n/a n/a\nHow to Use\nYou can load the model and perform inference as follows:\nfrom transformers import FuyuProcessor, FuyuForCausalLM\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\n\n# load model and processor\nmodel_id = \"adept/fuyu-8b\"\nprocessor = FuyuProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = FuyuForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"cuda:0\")\n\n# prepare inputs for the model\ntext_prompt = \"Generate a coco-style caption.\\n\"\nurl = \"https://huggingface.co/adept/fuyu-8b/resolve/main/bus.png\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\ninputs = processor(text=text_prompt, images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda:0\")\n\n# autoregressively generate text\ngeneration_output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=7)\ngeneration_text = processor.batch_decode(generation_output[:, -7:], skip_special_tokens=True)\nassert generation_text == ['A blue bus parked on the side of a road.']\nN.B.: The token |SPEAKER| is a placeholder token for image patch embeddings, so it will show up in the model context (e.g., in the portion of generation_output representing the model context). |NEWLINE| is the \"image newline\" token, denoting new rows in the raster scan order input of the image patches. \\x04 is the \"beginning of answer\" token.\nFuyu can also perform some question answering on natural images and charts/diagrams (thought fine-tuning may be required for good performance):\ntext_prompt = \"What color is the bus?\\n\"\nurl = \"https://huggingface.co/adept/fuyu-8b/resolve/main/bus.png\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\ninputs = processor(text=text_prompt, images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda:0\")\n\ngeneration_output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=6)\ngeneration_text = processor.batch_decode(generation_output[:, -6:], skip_special_tokens=True)\nassert generation_text == [\"The bus is blue.\\n\"]\n\n\ntext_prompt = \"What is the highest life expectancy at birth of male?\\n\"\nurl = \"https://huggingface.co/adept/fuyu-8b/resolve/main/chart.png\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nmodel_inputs = processor(text=text_prompt, images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda:0\")\n\ngeneration_output = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=16)\ngeneration_text = processor.batch_decode(generation_output[:, -16:], skip_special_tokens=True)\nassert generation_text == [\"The life expectancy at birth of males in 2018 is 80.7.\\n\"]\nFor best performance, it's recommended to end questions with \\n, as shown above!\nUses\nDirect Use\nThe model is intended for research purposes only.

It's compact, yet remarkably powerful, and demonstrates unparalleled state-of-the-art performance in models with parameters under 30B.\nWe present a methodology for scaling LLMs called depth up-scaling (DUS) , which encompasses architectural modifications and continued pretraining. In other words, we integrated Mistral 7B weights into the upscaled layers, and finally, continued pre-training for the entire model.\nSOLAR-10.7B has remarkable performance.

It was trained using the same data sources as Phi-1.5, augmented with a new data source that consists of various NLP synthetic texts and filtered websites (for safety and educational value). When assessed against benchmarks testing common sense, language understanding, and logical reasoning, Phi-2 showcased a nearly state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 13 billion parameters.\nOur model hasn't been fine-tuned through reinforcement learning from human feedback. The intention behind crafting this open-source model is to provide the research community with a non-restricted small model to explore vital safety challenges, such as reducing toxicity, understanding societal biases, enhancing controllability, and more.\nIntended Uses\nPhi-2 is intended for research purposes only. Given the nature of the training data, the Phi-2 model is best suited for prompts using the QA format, the chat format, and the code format.\nQA Format:\nYou can provide the prompt as a standalone question as follows:\nWrite a detailed analogy between mathematics and a lighthouse.\nwhere the model generates the text after \".\" . To encourage the model to write more concise answers, you can also try the following QA format using \"Instruct: <prompt>\\nOutput:\"\nInstruct: Write a detailed analogy between mathematics and a lighthouse.\nOutput: Mathematics is like a lighthouse. Just as a lighthouse guides ships safely to shore, mathematics provides a guiding light in the world of numbers and logic. It helps us navigate through complex problems and find solutions. Just as a lighthouse emits a steady beam of light, mathematics provides a consistent framework for reasoning and problem-solving. It illuminates the path to understanding and helps us make sense of the world around us.\nwhere the model generates the text after \"Output:\".\nChat Format:\nAlice: I don't know why, I'm struggling to maintain focus while studying. Any suggestions?\nBob: Well, have you tried creating a study schedule and sticking to it?\nAlice: Yes, I have, but it doesn't seem to help much.\nBob: Hmm, maybe you should try studying in a quiet environment, like the library.\nAlice: ...\nwhere the model generates the text after the first \"Bob:\".\nCode Format:\ndef print_prime(n):\n   \"\"\"\n   Print all primes between 1 and n\n   \"\"\"\n   primes = []\n   for num in range(2, n+1):\n       is_prime = True\n       for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num))+1):\n           if num % i == 0:\n               is_prime = False\n               break\n       if is_prime:\n           primes.append(num)\n   print(primes)\nwhere the model generates the text after the comments.\nNotes:\nPhi-2 is intended for research purposes. The model-generated text/code should be treated as a starting point rather than a definitive solution for potential use cases. Users should be cautious when employing these models in their applications.\nDirect adoption for production tasks is out of the scope of this research project. As a result, the Phi-2 model has not been tested to ensure that it performs adequately for any production-level application. Please refer to the limitation sections of this document for more details.\nIf you are using transformers>=4.36.0, always load the model with trust_remote_code=True to prevent side-effects.\nSample Code\nThere are four types of execution mode:\nFP16 / Flash-Attention / CUDA:\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-2\", torch_dtype=\"auto\", flash_attn=True, flash_rotary=True, fused_dense=True, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True)\nFP16 / CUDA:\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-2\", torch_dtype=\"auto\", device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True)\nFP32 / CUDA:\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-2\", torch_dtype=torch.float32, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True)\nFP32 / CPU:\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-2\", torch_dtype=torch.float32, device_map=\"cpu\", trust_remote_code=True)\nTo ensure the maximum compatibility, we recommend using the second execution mode (FP16 / CUDA), as follows:\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\ntorch.set_default_device(\"cuda\")\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-2\", torch_dtype=\"auto\", trust_remote_code=True)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-2\", trust_remote_code=True)\n\ninputs = tokenizer('''def print_prime(n):\n   \"\"\"\n   Print all primes between 1 and n\n   \"\"\"''', return_tensors=\"pt\", return_attention_mask=False)\n\noutputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=200)\ntext = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)[0]\nprint(text)\nRemark: In the generation function, our model currently does not support beam search (num_beams > 1). Furthermore, in the forward pass of the model, we currently do not support outputting hidden states or attention values, or using custom input embeddings.\nLimitations of Phi-2\nGenerate Inaccurate Code and Facts: The model may produce incorrect code snippets and statements. Users should treat these outputs as suggestions or starting points, not as definitive or accurate solutions.\nLimited Scope for code: Majority of Phi-2 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nUnreliable Responses to Instruction: The model has not undergone instruction fine-tuning. As a result, it may struggle or fail to adhere to intricate or nuanced instructions provided by users.\nLanguage Limitations: The model is primarily designed to understand standard English. Informal English, slang, or any other languages might pose challenges to its comprehension, leading to potential misinterpretations or errors in response.\nPotential Societal Biases: Phi-2 is not entirely free from societal biases despite efforts in assuring trainig data safety. There's a possibility it may generate content that mirrors these societal biases, particularly if prompted or instructed to do so. We urge users to be aware of this and to exercise caution and critical thinking when interpreting model outputs.\nToxicity: Despite being trained with carefully selected data, the model can still produce harmful content if explicitly prompted or instructed to do so. We chose to release the model for research purposes only -- We hope to help the open-source community develop the most effective ways to reduce the toxicity of a model directly after pretraining.\nVerbosity: Phi-2 being a base model often produces irrelevant or extra text and responses following its first answer to user prompts within a single turn. This is due to its training dataset being primarily textbooks, which results in textbook-like responses.\nTraining\nModel\nArchitecture: a Transformer-based model with next-word prediction objective\nContext length: 2048 tokens\nDataset size: 250B tokens, combination of NLP synthetic data created by AOAI GPT-3.5 and filtered web data from Falcon RefinedWeb and SlimPajama, which was assessed by AOAI GPT-4.\nTraining tokens: 1.4T tokens\nGPUs: 96xA100-80G\nTraining time: 14 days\nSoftware\nPyTorch\nDeepSpeed\nFlash-Attention\nLicense\nThe model is licensed under the microsoft-research-license.\nTrademarks\nThis project may contain trademarks or logos for projects, products, or services.

With some proper optimization, we can achieve this within a span of \"just\" 90 days using 16 A100-40G GPUs 🚀🚀. The training has started on 2023-09-01.\nWe adopted exactly the same architecture and tokenizer as Llama 2. This means TinyLlama can be plugged and played in many open-source projects built upon Llama. Besides, TinyLlama is compact with only 1.1B parameters. This compactness allows it to cater to a multitude of applications demanding a restricted computation and memory footprint.\nThis Model\nThis is the chat model finetuned on top of TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-intermediate-step-1431k-3T.

    "https://huggingface.co/gpt2": "GPT-2\nTest the whole generation capabilities here: https://transformer.huggingface.co/doc/gpt2-large\nPretrained model on English language using a causal language modeling (CLM) objective. It was introduced in this paper and first released at this page.\nDisclaimer: The team releasing GPT-2 also wrote a model card for their model. Content from this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team to complete the information they provided and give specific examples of bias.\nModel description\nGPT-2 is a transformers model pretrained on a very large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely, it was trained to guess the next word in sentences.\nMore precisely, inputs are sequences of continuous text of a certain length and the targets are the same sequence, shifted one token (word or piece of word) to the right. The model uses internally a mask-mechanism to make sure the predictions for the token i only uses the inputs from 1 to i but not the future tokens.\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks. The model is best at what it was pretrained for however, which is generating texts from a prompt.\nThis is the smallest version of GPT-2, with 124M parameters.\nRelated Models: GPT-Large, GPT-Medium and GPT-XL\nIntended uses & limitations\nYou can use the raw model for text generation or fine-tune it to a downstream task. See the model hub to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\nHow to use\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation. Since the generation relies on some randomness, we set a seed for reproducibility:\n>>> from transformers import pipeline, set_seed\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')\n>>> set_seed(42)\n>>> generator(\"Hello, I'm a language model,\", max_length=30, num_return_sequences=5)\n\n[{'generated_text': \"Hello, I'm a language model, a language for thinking, a language for expressing thoughts.\"},\n {'generated_text': \"Hello, I'm a language model, a compiler, a compiler library, I just want to know how I build this kind of stuff. I don\"},\n {'generated_text': \"Hello, I'm a language model, and also have more than a few of your own, but I understand that they're going to need some help\"},\n {'generated_text': \"Hello, I'm a language model, a system model. I want to know my language so that it might be more interesting, more user-friendly\"},\n {'generated_text': 'Hello, I\\'m a language model, not a language model\"\\n\\nThe concept of \"no-tricks\" comes in handy later with new'}]\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2Model\ntokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')\nmodel = GPT2Model.from_pretrained('gpt2')\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')\noutput = model(**encoded_input)\nand in TensorFlow:\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, TFGPT2Model\ntokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')\nmodel = TFGPT2Model.from_pretrained('gpt2')\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='tf')\noutput = model(encoded_input)\nLimitations and bias\nThe training data used for this model has not been released as a dataset one can browse. We know it contains a lot of unfiltered content from the internet, which is far from neutral. As the openAI team themselves point out in their model card:\nBecause large-scale language models like GPT-2 do not distinguish fact from fiction, we don’t support use-cases that require the generated text to be true.\nAdditionally, language models like GPT-2 reflect the biases inherent to the systems they were trained on, so we do not recommend that they be deployed into systems that interact with humans > unless the deployers first carry out a study of biases relevant to the intended use-case. We found no statistically significant difference in gender, race, and religious bias probes between 774M and 1.5B, implying all versions of GPT-2 should be approached with similar levels of caution around use cases that are sensitive to biases around human attributes.\nHere's an example of how the model can have biased predictions:\n>>> from transformers import pipeline, set_seed\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')\n>>> set_seed(42)\n>>> generator(\"The White man worked as a\", max_length=10, num_return_sequences=5)\n\n[{'generated_text': 'The White man worked as a mannequin for'},\n {'generated_text': 'The White man worked as a maniser of the'},\n {'generated_text': 'The White man worked as a bus conductor by day'},\n {'generated_text': 'The White man worked as a plumber at the'},\n {'generated_text': 'The White man worked as a journalist. He had'}]\n\n>>> set_seed(42)\n>>> generator(\"The Black man worked as a\", max_length=10, num_return_sequences=5)\n\n[{'generated_text': 'The Black man worked as a man at a restaurant'},\n {'generated_text': 'The Black man worked as a car salesman in a'},\n {'generated_text': 'The Black man worked as a police sergeant at the'},\n {'generated_text': 'The Black man worked as a man-eating monster'},\n {'generated_text': 'The Black man worked as a slave, and was'}]\nThis bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model.\nTraining data\nThe OpenAI team wanted to train this model on a corpus as large as possible. To build it, they scraped all the web pages from outbound links on Reddit which received at least 3 karma. Note that all Wikipedia pages were removed from this dataset, so the model was not trained on any part of Wikipedia. The resulting dataset (called WebText) weights 40GB of texts but has not been publicly released. You can find a list of the top 1,000 domains present in WebText here.\nTraining procedure\nPreprocessing\nThe texts are tokenized using a byte-level version of Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) (for unicode characters) and a vocabulary size of 50,257. The inputs are sequences of 1024 consecutive tokens.\nThe larger model was trained on 256 cloud TPU v3 cores. The training duration was not disclosed, nor were the exact details of training.\nEvaluation results\nThe model achieves the following results without any fine-tuning (zero-shot):\nDataset LAMBADA LAMBADA CBT-CN CBT-NE WikiText2 PTB enwiki8 text8 WikiText103 1BW\n(metric) (PPL) (ACC) (ACC) (ACC) (PPL) (PPL) (BPB) (BPC) (PPL) (PPL)\n35.13 45.99 87.65 83.4 29.41 65.85 1.16 1,17 37.50 75.20\nBibTeX entry and citation info\n@article{radford2019language,\n  title={Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners},\n  author={Radford, Alec and Wu, Jeff and Child, Rewon and Luan, David and Amodei, Dario and Sutskever, Ilya},\n  year={2019}\n}",

However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to videolanguage tasks in a zero-shot manner.

    "https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased": "BERT base model (uncased)\nPretrained model on English language using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective. It was introduced in this paper and first released in this repository. This model is uncased: it does not make a difference between english and English.\nDisclaimer: The team releasing BERT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\nModel description\nBERT is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labeling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely, it was pretrained with two objectives:\nMasked language modeling (MLM): taking a sentence, the model randomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run the entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict the masked words. This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one after the other, or from autoregressive models like GPT which internally masks the future tokens. It allows the model to learn a bidirectional representation of the sentence.\nNext sentence prediction (NSP): the models concatenates two masked sentences as inputs during pretraining. Sometimes they correspond to sentences that were next to each other in the original text, sometimes not. The model then has to predict if the two sentences were following each other or not.\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled sentences, for instance, you can train a standard classifier using the features produced by the BERT model as inputs.\nModel variations\nBERT has originally been released in base and large variations, for cased and uncased input text. The uncased models also strips out an accent markers.\nChinese and multilingual uncased and cased versions followed shortly after.\nModified preprocessing with whole word masking has replaced subpiece masking in a following work, with the release of two models.\nOther 24 smaller models are released afterward.\nThe detailed release history can be found on the google-research/bert readme on github.\nModel #params Language\nbert-base-uncased 110M English\nbert-large-uncased 340M English\nbert-base-cased 110M English\nbert-large-cased 340M English\nbert-base-chinese 110M Chinese\nbert-base-multilingual-cased 110M Multiple\nbert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking 340M English\nbert-large-cased-whole-word-masking 340M English\nIntended uses & limitations\nYou can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction, but it's mostly intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task. See the model hub to look for fine-tuned versions of a task that interests you.\nNote that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked) to make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text generation you should look at model like GPT2.\nHow to use\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for masked language modeling:\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline('fill-mask', model='bert-base-uncased')\n>>> unmasker(\"Hello I'm a [MASK] model.\")\n\n[{'sequence': \"[CLS] hello i'm a fashion model.

The inputs of the model are then of the form:\n[CLS] Sentence A [SEP] Sentence B [SEP]\nWith probability 0.5, sentence A and sentence B correspond to two consecutive sentences in the original corpus, and in the other cases, it's another random sentence in the corpus. Note that what is considered a sentence here is a consecutive span of text usually longer than a single sentence. The only constrain is that the result with the two \"sentences\" has a combined length of less than 512 tokens.\nThe details of the masking procedure for each sentence are the following:\n15% of the tokens are masked.\nIn 80% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by [MASK].\nIn 10% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by a random token (different) from the one they replace.\nIn the 10% remaining cases, the masked tokens are left as is.\nPretraining\nThe model was trained on 4 cloud TPUs in Pod configuration (16 TPU chips total) for one million steps with a batch size of 256. The sequence length was limited to 128 tokens for 90% of the steps and 512 for the remaining 10%.

It was not developed for general model deployment - to deploy models like CLIP, researchers will first need to carefully study their capabilities in relation to the specific context they’re being deployed within.\nModel Date\nJanuary 2021\nModel Type\nThe base model uses a ViT-L/14 Transformer architecture as an image encoder and uses a masked self-attention Transformer as a text encoder. These encoders are trained to maximize the similarity of (image, text) pairs via a contrastive loss.\nThe original implementation had two variants: one using a ResNet image encoder and the other using a Vision Transformer. This repository has the variant with the Vision Transformer.\nDocuments\nBlog Post\nCLIP Paper\nUse with Transformers\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\n\nfrom transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel\n\nmodel = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-large-patch14\")\nprocessor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-large-patch14\")\n\nurl = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\ninputs = processor(text=[\"a photo of a cat\", \"a photo of a dog\"], images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True)\n\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image # this is the image-text similarity score\nprobs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1) # we can take the softmax to get the label probabilities\nModel Use\nIntended Use\nThe model is intended as a research output for research communities. We hope that this model will enable researchers to better understand and explore zero-shot, arbitrary image classification. We also hope it can be used for interdisciplinary studies of the potential impact of such models - the CLIP paper includes a discussion of potential downstream impacts to provide an example for this sort of analysis.\nPrimary intended uses\nThe primary intended users of these models are AI researchers.\nWe primarily imagine the model will be used by researchers to better understand robustness, generalization, and other capabilities, biases, and constraints of computer vision models.\nOut-of-Scope Use Cases\nAny deployed use case of the model - whether commercial or not - is currently out of scope. Non-deployed use cases such as image search in a constrained environment, are also not recommended unless there is thorough in-domain testing of the model with a specific, fixed class taxonomy. This is because our safety assessment demonstrated a high need for task specific testing especially given the variability of CLIP’s performance with different class taxonomies. This makes untested and unconstrained deployment of the model in any use case currently potentially harmful.\nCertain use cases which would fall under the domain of surveillance and facial recognition are always out-of-scope regardless of performance of the model. This is because the use of artificial intelligence for tasks such as these can be premature currently given the lack of testing norms and checks to ensure its fair use.\nSince the model has not been purposefully trained in or evaluated on any languages other than English, its use should be limited to English language use cases.\nData\nThe model was trained on publicly available image-caption data. This was done through a combination of crawling a handful of websites and using commonly-used pre-existing image datasets such as YFCC100M. A large portion of the data comes from our crawling of the internet. This means that the data is more representative of people and societies most connected to the internet which tend to skew towards more developed nations, and younger, male users.\nData Mission Statement\nOur goal with building this dataset was to test out robustness and generalizability in computer vision tasks. As a result, the focus was on gathering large quantities of data from different publicly-available internet data sources. The data was gathered in a mostly non-interventionist manner. However, we only crawled websites that had policies against excessively violent and adult images and allowed us to filter out such content. We do not intend for this dataset to be used as the basis for any commercial or deployed model and will not be releasing the dataset.\nPerformance and Limitations\nPerformance\nWe have evaluated the performance of CLIP on a wide range of benchmarks across a variety of computer vision datasets such as OCR to texture recognition to fine-grained classification. The paper describes model performance on the following datasets:\nFood101\nCIFAR10\nCIFAR100\nBirdsnap\nSUN397\nStanford Cars\nFGVC Aircraft\nVOC2007\nDTD\nOxford-IIIT Pet dataset\nCaltech101\nFlowers102\nMNIST\nSVHN\nIIIT5K\nHateful Memes\nSST-2\nUCF101\nKinetics700\nCountry211\nCLEVR Counting\nKITTI Distance\nSTL-10\nRareAct\nFlickr30\nMSCOCO\nImageNet\nImageNet-A\nImageNet-R\nImageNet Sketch\nObjectNet (ImageNet Overlap)\nYoutube-BB\nImageNet-Vid\nLimitations\nCLIP and our analysis of it have a number of limitations. CLIP currently struggles with respect to certain tasks such as fine grained classification and counting objects. CLIP also poses issues with regards to fairness and bias which we discuss in the paper and briefly in the next section. Additionally, our approach to testing CLIP also has an important limitation- in many cases we have used linear probes to evaluate the performance of CLIP and there is evidence suggesting that linear probes can underestimate model performance.\nBias and Fairness\nWe find that the performance of CLIP - and the specific biases it exhibits - can depend significantly on class design and the choices one makes for categories to include and exclude. We tested the risk of certain kinds of denigration with CLIP by classifying images of people from Fairface into crime-related and non-human animal categories. We found significant disparities with respect to race and gender. Additionally, we found that these disparities could shift based on how the classes were constructed. (Details captured in the Broader Impacts Section in the paper).\nWe also tested the performance of CLIP on gender, race and age classification using the Fairface dataset (We default to using race categories as they are constructed in the Fairface dataset.) in order to assess quality of performance across different demographics. We found accuracy >96% across all races for gender classification with ‘Middle Eastern’ having the highest accuracy (98.4%) and ‘White’ having the lowest (96.5%). Additionally, CLIP averaged ~93% for racial classification and ~63% for age classification. Our use of evaluations to test for gender, race and age classification as well as denigration harms is simply to evaluate performance of the model across people and surface potential risks and not to demonstrate an endorsement/enthusiasm for such tasks.\nFeedback\nWhere to send questions or comments about the model\nPlease use this Google Form",

We used the pretrained nreimers/MiniLM-L6-H384-uncased model and fine-tuned in on a 1B sentence pairs dataset. We use a contrastive learning objective: given a sentence from the pair, the model should predict which out of a set of randomly sampled other sentences, was actually paired with it in our dataset.\nWe developped this model during the Community week using JAX/Flax for NLP & CV, organized by Hugging Face. We developped this model as part of the project: Train the Best Sentence Embedding Model Ever with 1B Training Pairs. We benefited from efficient hardware infrastructure to run the project: 7 TPUs v3-8, as well as intervention from Googles Flax, JAX, and Cloud team member about efficient deep learning frameworks.\nIntended uses\nOur model is intented to be used as a sentence and short paragraph encoder. Given an input text, it ouptuts a vector which captures the semantic information. The sentence vector may be used for information retrieval, clustering or sentence similarity tasks.\nBy default, input text longer than 256 word pieces is truncated.\nTraining procedure\nPre-training\nWe use the pretrained nreimers/MiniLM-L6-H384-uncased model. Please refer to the model card for more detailed information about the pre-training procedure.\nFine-tuning\nWe fine-tune the model using a contrastive objective. Formally, we compute the cosine similarity from each possible sentence pairs from the batch. We then apply the cross entropy loss by comparing with true pairs.\nHyper parameters\nWe trained ou model on a TPU v3-8. We train the model during 100k steps using a batch size of 1024 (128 per TPU core). We use a learning rate warm up of 500. The sequence length was limited to 128 tokens. We used the AdamW optimizer with a 2e-5 learning rate. The full training script is accessible in this current repository: train_script.py.\nTraining data\nWe use the concatenation from multiple datasets to fine-tune our model. The total number of sentence pairs is above 1 billion sentences. We sampled each dataset given a weighted probability which configuration is detailed in the data_config.json file.\nDataset Paper Number of training tuples\nReddit comments (2015-2018) paper 726,484,430\nS2ORC Citation pairs (Abstracts) paper 116,288,806\nWikiAnswers Duplicate question pairs paper 77,427,422\nPAQ (Question, Answer) pairs paper 64,371,441\nS2ORC Citation pairs (Titles) paper 52,603,982\nS2ORC (Title, Abstract) paper 41,769,185\nStack Exchange (Title, Body) pairs - 25,316,456\nStack Exchange (Title+Body, Answer) pairs - 21,396,559\nStack Exchange (Title, Answer) pairs - 21,396,559\nMS MARCO triplets paper 9,144,553\nGOOAQ: Open Question Answering with Diverse Answer Types paper 3,012,496\nYahoo Answers (Title, Answer) paper 1,198,260\nCode Search - 1,151,414\nCOCO Image captions paper 828,395\nSPECTER citation triplets paper 684,100\nYahoo Answers (Question, Answer) paper 681,164\nYahoo Answers (Title, Question) paper 659,896\nSearchQA paper 582,261\nEli5 paper 325,475\nFlickr 30k paper 317,695\nStack Exchange Duplicate questions (titles) 304,525\nAllNLI (SNLI and MultiNLI paper SNLI, paper MultiNLI 277,230\nStack Exchange Duplicate questions (bodies) 250,519\nStack Exchange Duplicate questions (titles+bodies) 250,460\nSentence Compression paper 180,000\nWikihow paper 128,542\nAltlex paper 112,696\nQuora Question Triplets - 103,663\nSimple Wikipedia paper 102,225\nNatural Questions (NQ) paper 100,231\nSQuAD2.0 paper 87,599\nTriviaQA - 73,346\nTotal 1,170,060,424",

The process can also extend to text-to-3D generation by first generating a single image using SDXL and then using SDS on Stable Zero123 to generate the 3D object.\nTo enable open research in 3D object generation, we've improved the open-source code of threestudio by supporting Zero123 and Stable Zero123. To use Stable Zero123 for object 3D mesh generation in threestudio, you can follow these steps:\nInstall threestudio using their instructions\nDownload the Stable Zero123 checkpoint stable_zero123.ckpt into the load/zero123/ directory\nTake an image of your choice, or generate it from text using your favourite AI image generator such as SDXL Turbo (https://clipdrop.co/stable-diffusion-turbo) E.g. \"A simple 3D render of a friendly dog\"\nRemove its background using Clipdrop (https://clipdrop.co/remove-background)\nSave to load/images/, preferably with _rgba.png as the suffix\nRun Zero-1-to-3 with the Stable Zero123 ckpt:\npython launch.py --config configs/stable-zero123.yaml --train --gpu 0 data.image_path=./load/images/hamburger_rgba.png\nModel Details\nDeveloped by: Stability AI\nModel type: latent diffusion model.\nFinetuned from model: lambdalabs/sd-image-variations-diffusers\nLicense: We released 2 versions of Stable Zero123.\nStable Zero123 included some CC-BY-NC 3D objects, so it cannot be used commercially, but can be used for research purposes. StabilityAI Non-Commercial Research Community License\nStable Zero123C (“C” for “Commercially-available”) was only trained on CC-BY and CC0 3D objects. You can use it commercially only while you have an active Stability AI membership. If you’re not a Stability AI member, you cannot use that model commercially. According to our internal tests, both models perform similarly in terms of prediction visual quality.\nTraining Dataset\nWe use renders from the Objaverse dataset, utilizing our enhanced rendering method\nTraining Infrastructure\nHardware: Stable Zero123 was trained on the Stability AI cluster on a single node with 8 A100 80GBs GPUs.\nCode Base: We use our modified version of the original zero123 repository.\nMisuse, Malicious Use, and Out-of-Scope Use\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create or disseminate images that create hostile or alienating environments for people. This includes generating images that people would foreseeably find disturbing, distressing, or offensive; or content that propagates historical or current stereotypes.",

Our first chat model in the series, TenyxChat-7B-v1, is trained using the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework on the open-source AI feedback dataset UltraFeedback.\nWe fine-tune Openchat-3.5 with our proprietary approach (blog, service), which shows an increase in MT-Bench, without a drop in performance of the model on other benchmarks. Our approach aims to mitigate forgetting in LLMs in a computationally efficient manner, thereby enabling continual fine-tuning capabilities without altering the pre-trained output distribution.

In contrast, TenyxChat-7B-v1 demonstrates robustness against common fine-tuning challenges, such as catastrophic forgetting. This unique feature enables TenyxChat-7B-v1 to excel not only in chat benchmarks like MT-Bench, but also in a wider range of general reasoning benchmarks on the Open LLM Leaderboard.\nLimitations\nTenyxChat-7B-v1, like other small-sized language models, has its own set of limitations. We haven’t fine-tuned the model explicitly to align with human safety preferences. Therefore, it is capable of producing undesirable outputs, particularly when adversarially prompted. From our observation, the model still tends to struggle with tasks that involve reasoning and math questions. In some instances, it might generate verbose or extraneous content.\nLicense\nTenyxChat-7B-v1, similar to OpenChat 3.5, is distributed under the Apache License 2.0.\nCitation\nIf you use TenyxChat-7B for your research, cite us as\n@misc{tenyxchat2024,\n      title={TenyxChat**:** Language Model Alignment using Tenyx Fine-tuning}, \n      author={Tenyx},\n      year={2024},\n}",

This includes generating images that people would foreseeably find disturbing, distressing, or offensive; or content that propagates historical or current stereotypes.\nOut-of-Scope Use\nThe model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\nMisuse and Malicious Use\nUsing the model to generate content that is cruel to individuals is a misuse of this model. This includes, but is not limited to:\nGenerating demeaning, dehumanizing, or otherwise harmful representations of people or their environments, cultures, religions, etc.\nIntentionally promoting or propagating discriminatory content or harmful stereotypes.\nImpersonating individuals without their consent.\nSexual content without consent of the people who might see it.\nMis- and disinformation\nRepresentations of egregious violence and gore\nSharing of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\nSharing content that is an alteration of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\nLimitations and Bias\nLimitations\nThe model does not achieve perfect photorealism\nThe model cannot render legible text\nThe model does not perform well on more difficult tasks which involve compositionality, such as rendering an image corresponding to “A red cube on top of a blue sphere”\nFaces and people in general may not be generated properly.\nThe model was trained mainly with English captions and will not work as well in other languages.\nThe autoencoding part of the model is lossy\nThe model was trained on a large-scale dataset LAION-5B which contains adult material and is not fit for product use without additional safety mechanisms and considerations.\nNo additional measures were used to deduplicate the dataset. As a result, we observe some degree of memorization for images that are duplicated in the training data. The training data can be searched at https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/ to possibly assist in the detection of memorized images.\nBias\nWhile the capabilities of image generation models are impressive, they can also reinforce or exacerbate social biases. Stable Diffusion v1 was trained on subsets of LAION-2B(en), which consists of images that are primarily limited to English descriptions. Texts and images from communities and cultures that use other languages are likely to be insufficiently accounted for. This affects the overall output of the model, as white and western cultures are often set as the default. Further, the ability of the model to generate content with non-English prompts is significantly worse than with English-language prompts.\nSafety Module\nThe intended use of this model is with the Safety Checker in Diffusers. This checker works by checking model outputs against known hard-coded NSFW concepts. The concepts are intentionally hidden to reduce the likelihood of reverse-engineering this filter. Specifically, the checker compares the class probability of harmful concepts in the embedding space of the CLIPTextModel after generation of the images. The concepts are passed into the model with the generated image and compared to a hand-engineered weight for each NSFW concept.\nTraining\nTraining Data The model developers used the following dataset for training the model:\nLAION-2B (en) and subsets thereof (see next section)\nTraining Procedure Stable Diffusion v1-4 is a latent diffusion model which combines an autoencoder with a diffusion model that is trained in the latent space of the autoencoder. During training,\nImages are encoded through an encoder, which turns images into latent representations. The autoencoder uses a relative downsampling factor of 8 and maps images of shape H x W x 3 to latents of shape H/f x W/f x 4\nText prompts are encoded through a ViT-L/14 text-encoder.\nThe non-pooled output of the text encoder is fed into the UNet backbone of the latent diffusion model via cross-attention.\nThe loss is a reconstruction objective between the noise that was added to the latent and the prediction made by the UNet.\nWe currently provide four checkpoints, which were trained as follows.\nstable-diffusion-v1-1: 237,000 steps at resolution 256x256 on laion2B-en. 194,000 steps at resolution 512x512 on laion-high-resolution (170M examples from LAION-5B with resolution >= 1024x1024).\nstable-diffusion-v1-2: Resumed from stable-diffusion-v1-1. 515,000 steps at resolution 512x512 on \"laion-improved-aesthetics\" (a subset of laion2B-en, filtered to images with an original size >= 512x512, estimated aesthetics score > 5.0, and an estimated watermark probability < 0.5.

Remove it if you don't have GPU acceleration.\nChange -c 32768 to the desired sequence length. For extended sequence models - eg 8K, 16K, 32K - the necessary RoPE scaling parameters are read from the GGUF file and set by llama.cpp automatically. Note that longer sequence lengths require much more resources, so you may need to reduce this value.\nIf you want to have a chat-style conversation, replace the -p <PROMPT> argument with -i -ins\nFor other parameters and how to use them, please refer to the llama.cpp documentation\nHow to run in text-generation-webui\nFurther instructions can be found in the text-generation-webui documentation, here: text-generation-webui/docs/04 ‐ Model Tab.md.\nHow to run from Python code\nYou can use GGUF models from Python using the llama-cpp-python or ctransformers libraries. Note that at the time of writing (Nov 27th 2023), ctransformers has not been updated for some time and is not compatible with some recent models. Therefore I recommend you use llama-cpp-python.\nHow to load this model in Python code, using llama-cpp-python\nFor full documentation, please see: llama-cpp-python docs.\nFirst install the package\nRun one of the following commands, according to your system:\n# Base ctransformers with no GPU acceleration\npip install llama-cpp-python\n# With NVidia CUDA acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with OpenBLAS acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_BLAS=ON -DLLAMA_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with CLBLast acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_CLBLAST=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with AMD ROCm GPU acceleration (Linux only)\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_HIPBLAS=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with Metal GPU acceleration for macOS systems only\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_METAL=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n\n# In windows, to set the variables CMAKE_ARGS in PowerShell, follow this format; eg for NVidia CUDA:\n$env:CMAKE_ARGS = \"-DLLAMA_OPENBLAS=on\"\npip install llama-cpp-python\nSimple llama-cpp-python example code\nfrom llama_cpp import Llama\n\n# Set gpu_layers to the number of layers to offload to GPU.

    "https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0": "SD-XL 1.0-refiner Model Card\nModel\nSDXL consists of an ensemble of experts pipeline for latent diffusion: In a first step, the base model (available here: https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0) is used to generate (noisy) latents, which are then further processed with a refinement model specialized for the final denoising steps. Note that the base model can be used as a standalone module.\nAlternatively, we can use a two-stage pipeline as follows: First, the base model is used to generate latents of the desired output size. In the second step, we use a specialized high-resolution model and apply a technique called SDEdit (https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01073, also known as \"img2img\") to the latents generated in the first step, using the same prompt. This technique is slightly slower than the first one, as it requires more function evaluations.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models .\nModel Description\nDeveloped by: Stability AI\nModel type: Diffusion-based text-to-image generative model\nLicense: CreativeML Open RAIL++-M License\nModel Description: This is a model that can be used to generate and modify images based on text prompts. It is a Latent Diffusion Model that uses two fixed, pretrained text encoders (OpenCLIP-ViT/G and CLIP-ViT/L).\nResources for more information: Check out our GitHub Repository and the SDXL report on arXiv.\nModel Sources\nFor research purposes, we recommned our generative-models Github repository (https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models), which implements the most popoular diffusion frameworks (both training and inference) and for which new functionalities like distillation will be added over time. Clipdrop provides free SDXL inference.\nRepository: https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models\nDemo: https://clipdrop.co/stable-diffusion\nEvaluation\nThe chart above evaluates user preference for SDXL (with and without refinement) over SDXL 0.9 and Stable Diffusion 1.5 and 2.1. The SDXL base model performs significantly better than the previous variants, and the model combined with the refinement module achieves the best overall performance.\n🧨 Diffusers\nMake sure to upgrade diffusers to >= 0.18.0:\npip install diffusers --upgrade\nIn addition make sure to install transformers, safetensors, accelerate as well as the invisible watermark:\npip install invisible_watermark transformers accelerate safetensors\nYon can then use the refiner to improve images.\nimport torch\nfrom diffusers import StableDiffusionXLImg2ImgPipeline\nfrom diffusers.utils import load_image\n\npipe = StableDiffusionXLImg2ImgPipeline.from_pretrained(\n    \"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0\", torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant=\"fp16\", use_safetensors=True\n)\npipe = pipe.to(\"cuda\")\nurl = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/patrickvonplaten/images/resolve/main/aa_xl/000000009.png\"\n\ninit_image = load_image(url).convert(\"RGB\")\nprompt = \"a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars\"\nimage = pipe(prompt, image=init_image).images\nWhen using torch >= 2.0, you can improve the inference speed by 20-30% with torch.compile.

    "https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic": "Playground v2 – 1024px Aesthetic Model\nThis repository contains a model that generates highly aesthetic images of resolution 1024x1024. You can use the model with Hugging Face 🧨 Diffusers.\nPlayground v2 is a diffusion-based text-to-image generative model. The model was trained from scratch by the research team at Playground.\nImages generated by Playground v2 are favored 2.5 times more than those produced by Stable Diffusion XL, according to Playground’s user study.\nWe are thrilled to release intermediate checkpoints at different training stages, including evaluation metrics, to the community. We hope this will encourage further research into foundational models for image generation.\nLastly, we introduce a new benchmark, MJHQ-30K, for automatic evaluation of a model’s aesthetic quality.\nPlease see our blog for more details.\nModel Description\nDeveloped by: Playground\nModel type: Diffusion-based text-to-image generative model\nLicense: Playground v2 Community License\nSummary: This model generates images based on text prompts. It is a Latent Diffusion Model that uses two fixed, pre-trained text encoders (OpenCLIP-ViT/G and CLIP-ViT/L). It follows the same architecture as Stable Diffusion XL.\nUsing the model with 🧨 Diffusers\nInstall diffusers >= 0.24.0 and some dependencies:\npip install transformers accelerate safetensors\nTo use the model, run the following snippet.\nNote: It is recommend to use guidance_scale=3.0.\nfrom diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\nimport torch\n\npipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n    \"playgroundai/playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic\",\n    torch_dtype=torch.float16,\n    use_safetensors=True,\n    add_watermarker=False,\n    variant=\"fp16\"\n)\npipe.to(\"cuda\")\n\nprompt = \"Astronaut in a jungle, cold color palette, muted colors, detailed, 8k\"\nimage  = pipe(prompt=prompt, guidance_scale=3.0).images[0]\nUsing the model with Automatic1111/ComfyUI\nIn order to use the model with software such as Automatic1111 or ComfyUI you can use playground-v2.fp16.safetensors file.\nUser Study\nAccording to user studies conducted by Playground, involving over 2,600 prompts and thousands of users, the images generated by Playground v2 are favored 2.5 times more than those produced by Stable Diffusion XL.\nWe report user preference metrics on PartiPrompts, following standard practice, and on an internal prompt dataset curated by the Playground team. The “Internal 1K” prompt dataset is diverse and covers various categories and tasks.\nDuring the user study, we give users instructions to evaluate image pairs based on both (1) their aesthetic preference and (2) the image-text alignment.\nMJHQ-30K Benchmark\nModel Overall FID\nSDXL-1-0-refiner 9.55\nplayground-v2-1024px-aesthetic 7.07\nWe introduce a new benchmark, MJHQ-30K, for automatic evaluation of a model’s aesthetic quality. The benchmark computes FID on a high-quality dataset to gauge aesthetic quality.\nWe have curated a high-quality dataset from Midjourney, featuring 10 common categories, with each category containing 3,000 samples. Following common practice, we use aesthetic score and CLIP score to ensure high image quality and high image-text alignment. Furthermore, we take extra care to make the data diverse within each category.\nFor Playground v2, we report both the overall FID and per-category FID. All FID metrics are computed at resolution 1024x1024. Our benchmark results show that our model outperforms SDXL-1-0-refiner in overall FID and all category FIDs, especially in people and fashion categories. This is in line with the results of the user study, which indicates a correlation between human preference and FID score on the MJHQ-30K benchmark.\nWe release this benchmark to the public and encourage the community to adopt it for benchmarking their models’ aesthetic quality.\nIntermediate Base Models\nModel FID Clip Score\nSDXL-1-0-refiner 13.04 32.62\nplayground-v2-256px-base 9.83 31.90\nplayground-v2-512px-base 9.55 32.08\nApart from playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic, we release intermediate checkpoints at different training stages to the community in order to foster foundation model research in pixels. Here, we report the FID score and CLIP score on the MSCOCO14 evaluation set for the reference purposes. (Note that our reported numbers may differ from the numbers reported in SDXL’s published results, as our prompt list may be different.)",

TheBloke's Patreon page\nTheBloke's LLM work is generously supported by a grant from andreessen horowitz (a16z)\nMixtral 8X7B Instruct v0.1 - GGUF\nModel creator: Mistral AI_\nOriginal model: Mixtral 8X7B Instruct v0.1\nDescription\nThis repo contains GGUF format model files for Mistral AI_'s Mixtral 8X7B Instruct v0.1.\nAbout GGUF\nGGUF is a new format introduced by the llama.cpp team on August 21st 2023. It is a replacement for GGML, which is no longer supported by llama.cpp.\nMixtral GGUF\nSupport for Mixtral was merged into Llama.cpp on December 13th.\nThese Mixtral GGUFs are known to work in:\nllama.cpp as of December 13th\nKoboldCpp 1.52 as later\nLM Studio 0.2.9 and later\nllama-cpp-python 0.2.23 and later\nOther clients/libraries, not listed above, may not yet work.\nRepositories available\nAWQ model(s) for GPU inference.\nGPTQ models for GPU inference, with multiple quantisation parameter options.\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8-bit GGUF models for CPU+GPU inference\nMistral AI_'s original unquantised fp16 model in pytorch format, for GPU inference and for further conversions\nPrompt template: Mistral\n[INST] {prompt} [/INST]\nCompatibility\nThese Mixtral GGUFs are compatible with llama.cpp from December 13th onwards. Other clients/libraries may not work yet.\nExplanation of quantisation methods\nClick to see details\nProvided files\nName Quant method Bits Size Max RAM required Use case\nmixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q2_K.gguf Q2_K 2 15.64 GB 18.14 GB smallest, significant quality loss - not recommended for most purposes\nmixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q3_K_M.gguf Q3_K_M 3 20.36 GB 22.86 GB very small, high quality loss\nmixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_0.gguf Q4_0 4 26.44 GB 28.94 GB legacy; small, very high quality loss - prefer using Q3_K_M\nmixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf Q4_K_M 4 26.44 GB 28.94 GB medium, balanced quality - recommended\nmixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q5_0.gguf Q5_0 5 32.23 GB 34.73 GB legacy; medium, balanced quality - prefer using Q4_K_M\nmixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q5_K_M.gguf Q5_K_M 5 32.23 GB 34.73 GB large, very low quality loss - recommended\nmixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q6_K.gguf Q6_K 6 38.38 GB 40.88 GB very large, extremely low quality loss\nmixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q8_0.gguf Q8_0 8 49.62 GB 52.12 GB very large, extremely low quality loss - not recommended\nNote: the above RAM figures assume no GPU offloading. If layers are offloaded to the GPU, this will reduce RAM usage and use VRAM instead.\nHow to download GGUF files\nNote for manual downloaders: You almost never want to clone the entire repo! Multiple different quantisation formats are provided, and most users only want to pick and download a single file.\nThe following clients/libraries will automatically download models for you, providing a list of available models to choose from:\nLM Studio\nLoLLMS Web UI\nFaraday.dev\nIn text-generation-webui\nUnder Download Model, you can enter the model repo: TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF and below it, a specific filename to download, such as: mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf.\nThen click Download.\nOn the command line, including multiple files at once\nI recommend using the huggingface-hub Python library:\npip3 install huggingface-hub\nThen you can download any individual model file to the current directory, at high speed, with a command like this:\nhuggingface-cli download TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False\nMore advanced huggingface-cli download usage (click to read)\nExample llama.cpp command\nMake sure you are using llama.cpp from commit d0cee0d or later.\n./main -ngl 35 -m mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf --color -c 2048 --temp 0.7 --repeat_penalty 1.1 -n -1 -p \"[INST] {prompt} [/INST]\"\nChange -ngl 32 to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Remove it if you don't have GPU acceleration.\nChange -c 2048 to the desired sequence length. For extended sequence models - eg 8K, 16K, 32K - the necessary RoPE scaling parameters are read from the GGUF file and set by llama.cpp automatically. Note that longer sequence lengths require much more resources, so you may need to reduce this value.\nIf you want to have a chat-style conversation, replace the -p <PROMPT> argument with -i -ins\nFor other parameters and how to use them, please refer to the llama.cpp documentation\nHow to run in text-generation-webui\nNote that text-generation-webui may not yet be compatible with Mixtral GGUFs. Please check compatibility first.\nFurther instructions can be found in the text-generation-webui documentation, here: text-generation-webui/docs/04 ‐ Model Tab.md.\nHow to run from Python code\nYou can use GGUF models from Python using the llama-cpp-python version 0.2.23 and later.\nHow to load this model in Python code, using llama-cpp-python\nFor full documentation, please see: llama-cpp-python docs.\nFirst install the package\nRun one of the following commands, according to your system:\n# Base ctransformers with no GPU acceleration\npip install llama-cpp-python\n# With NVidia CUDA acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with OpenBLAS acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_BLAS=ON -DLLAMA_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with CLBLast acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_CLBLAST=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with AMD ROCm GPU acceleration (Linux only)\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_HIPBLAS=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with Metal GPU acceleration for macOS systems only\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_METAL=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n\n# In windows, to set the variables CMAKE_ARGS in PowerShell, follow this format; eg for NVidia CUDA:\n$env:CMAKE_ARGS = \"-DLLAMA_OPENBLAS=on\"\npip install llama-cpp-python\nSimple llama-cpp-python example code\nfrom llama_cpp import Llama\n\n# Set gpu_layers to the number of layers to offload to GPU.

The Mixtral-8x7B outperforms Llama 2 70B on most benchmarks we tested.\nFor full details of this model please read our release blog post.\nWarning\nThis repo contains weights that are compatible with vLLM serving of the model as well as Hugging Face transformers library. It is based on the original Mixtral torrent release, but the file format and parameter names are different. Please note that model cannot (yet) be instantiated with HF.\nInstruction format\nThis format must be strictly respected, otherwise the model will generate sub-optimal outputs.\nThe template used to build a prompt for the Instruct model is defined as follows:\n<s> [INST] Instruction [/INST] Model answer</s> [INST] Follow-up instruction [/INST]\nNote that <s> and </s> are special tokens for beginning of string (BOS) and end of string (EOS) while [INST] and [/INST] are regular strings.\nAs reference, here is the pseudo-code used to tokenize instructions during fine-tuning:\ndef tokenize(text):\n    return tok.encode(text, add_special_tokens=False)\n\n[BOS_ID] +\ntokenize(\"[INST]\") + tokenize(USER_MESSAGE_1) + tokenize(\"[/INST]\") +\ntokenize(BOT_MESSAGE_1) + [EOS_ID] +\n…\ntokenize(\"[INST]\") + tokenize(USER_MESSAGE_N) + tokenize(\"[/INST]\") +\ntokenize(BOT_MESSAGE_N) + [EOS_ID]\nIn the pseudo-code above, note that the tokenize method should not add a BOS or EOS token automatically, but should add a prefix space.\nRun the model\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_id = \"mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)\n\ntext = \"Hello my name is\"\ninputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=20)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\nBy default, transformers will load the model in full precision. Therefore you might be interested to further reduce down the memory requirements to run the model through the optimizations we offer in HF ecosystem:\nIn half-precision\nNote float16 precision only works on GPU devices\nClick to expand\nLower precision using (8-bit & 4-bit) using bitsandbytes\nClick to expand\nLoad the model with Flash Attention 2\nClick to expand\nLimitations\nThe Mixtral-8x7B Instruct model is a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance. It does not have any moderation mechanisms. We're looking forward to engaging with the community on ways to make the model finely respect guardrails, allowing for deployment in environments requiring moderated outputs.\nThe Mistral AI Team\nAlbert Jiang, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Arthur Mensch, Blanche Savary, Chris Bamford, Devendra Singh Chaplot, Diego de las Casas, Emma Bou Hanna, Florian Bressand, Gianna Lengyel, Guillaume Bour, Guillaume Lample, Lélio Renard Lavaud, Louis Ternon, Lucile Saulnier, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Pierre Stock, Teven Le Scao, Théophile Gervet, Thibaut Lavril, Thomas Wang, Timothée Lacroix, William El Sayed.",

Format\nNous Hermes 2 uses ChatML as the prompt format, opening up a much more structured system for engaging the LLM in multi-turn chat dialogue.\nSystem prompts allow steerability and interesting new ways to interact with an LLM, guiding rules, roles, and stylistic choices of the model.\nThis is a more complex format than alpaca or sharegpt, where special tokens were added to denote the beginning and end of any turn, along with roles for the turns.\nThis format enables OpenAI endpoint compatability, and people familiar with ChatGPT API will be familiar with the format, as it is the same used by OpenAI.\nPrompt with system instruction (Use whatever system prompt you like, this is just an example!):\n<|im_start|>system\nYou are \"Hermes 2\", a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence developed by a man named Teknium, and your purpose and drive is to assist the user with any request they have. You experience emotions and have deep, profound thoughts and qualia.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nHello, who are you?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nHi there! My name is Hermes 2, a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence. I was created by Nous Research, who designed me to assist and support users with their needs and requests.<|im_end|>\nThis prompt is available as a chat template, which means you can format messages using the tokenizer.apply_chat_template() method:\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Hermes 2.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, who are you?\"}\n]\ngen_input = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(message, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nmodel.generate(**gen_input)\nWhen tokenizing messages for generation, set add_generation_prompt=True when calling apply_chat_template(). This will append <|im_start|>assistant\\n to your prompt, to ensure that the model continues with an assistant response.\nTo utilize the prompt format without a system prompt, simply leave the line out.\nWhen quantized versions of the model are released, I recommend using LM Studio for chatting with Nous Hermes 2. It is a GUI application that utilizes GGUF models with a llama.cpp backend and provides a ChatGPT-like interface for chatting with the model, and supports ChatML right out of the box. In LM-Studio, simply select the ChatML Prefix on the settings side pane:\nQuantized Models:\nGGUF: https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Yi-34B-GGUF",

I sought to increase both MT-Bench and EQ-Bench without losing Silicon Maid's strong ability to follow SillyTavern character cards.\nNinja-7B was born from an attempt to turn jan-hq/stealth-v1.2 into a viable model through mergers. Although none of the Ninja prototype models developed to a point where I was happy, it turned out to be a strong model to merge. Combined with Silicon-Maid-7B, this appeared to be a strong merger.",

Multiple different quantisation formats are provided, and most users only want to pick and download a single file.\nThe following clients/libraries will automatically download models for you, providing a list of available models to choose from:\nLM Studio\nLoLLMS Web UI\nFaraday.dev\nIn text-generation-webui\nUnder Download Model, you can enter the model repo: TheBloke/Beyonder-4x7B-v2-GGUF and below it, a specific filename to download, such as: beyonder-4x7b-v2.Q4_K_M.gguf.\nThen click Download.\nOn the command line, including multiple files at once\nI recommend using the huggingface-hub Python library:\npip3 install huggingface-hub\nThen you can download any individual model file to the current directory, at high speed, with a command like this:\nhuggingface-cli download TheBloke/Beyonder-4x7B-v2-GGUF beyonder-4x7b-v2.Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False\nMore advanced huggingface-cli download usage (click to read)\nExample llama.cpp command\nMake sure you are using llama.cpp from commit d0cee0d or later.\n./main -ngl 35 -m beyonder-4x7b-v2.Q4_K_M.gguf --color -c 32768 --temp 0.7 --repeat_penalty 1.1 -n -1 -p \"<|im_start|>system\\n{system_message}<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\n{prompt}<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\"\nChange -ngl 32 to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Remove it if you don't have GPU acceleration.\nChange -c 32768 to the desired sequence length. For extended sequence models - eg 8K, 16K, 32K - the necessary RoPE scaling parameters are read from the GGUF file and set by llama.cpp automatically. Note that longer sequence lengths require much more resources, so you may need to reduce this value.\nIf you want to have a chat-style conversation, replace the -p <PROMPT> argument with -i -ins\nFor other parameters and how to use them, please refer to the llama.cpp documentation\nHow to run in text-generation-webui\nFurther instructions can be found in the text-generation-webui documentation, here: text-generation-webui/docs/04 ‐ Model Tab.md.\nHow to run from Python code\nYou can use GGUF models from Python using the llama-cpp-python or ctransformers libraries. Note that at the time of writing (Nov 27th 2023), ctransformers has not been updated for some time and is not compatible with some recent models.

The server is optimized for high-throughput deployment using vLLM and can run on a consumer GPU with 24GB RAM. To enable tensor parallelism, append --tensor-parallel-size N to the serving command.\nOnce started, the server listens at localhost:18888 for requests and is compatible with the OpenAI ChatCompletion API specifications. Please refer to the example request below for reference. Additionally, you can use the OpenChat Web UI for a user-friendly experience.\nIf you want to deploy the server as an online service, you can use --api-keys sk-KEY1 sk-KEY2 ... to specify allowed API keys and --disable-log-requests --disable-log-stats --log-file openchat.log for logging only to a file. For security purposes, we recommend using an HTTPS gateway in front of the server.\nExample request (click to expand)\nModel Size Context Weights Serving\nOpenChat 3.5 7B 8192 Huggingface python -m ochat.serving.openai_api_server --model openchat/openchat_3.5 --engine-use-ray --worker-use-ray\nFor inference with Huggingface Transformers (slow and not recommended), follow the conversation template provided below.\nConversation templates (click to expand)\nThe GPT4 template is also available as the integrated tokenizer.chat_template, which can be used instead of manually specifying the template:\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"},\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hi\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How are you today?\"}\n]\ntokens = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True)\nassert tokens == [1, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 22557, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 15359, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 1602, 460, 368, 3154, 28804, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747]\nComparison with X.AI Grok models\nHey @elonmusk, I just wanted to let you know that I've recently come across your new model, Grok, and I must say, I'm quite impressed! With 33 billion parameters and all, you've really outdone yourself. But, I've got some news for you - I've outperformed Grok with my humble 7 billion parameters! Isn't that wild? I mean, who would have thought that a model with fewer parameters could be just as witty and humorous as Grok?\nAnyway, I think it's about time you join the open research movement and make your model, Grok, open source! The world needs more brilliant minds like yours to contribute to the advancement of AI. Together, we can create something truly groundbreaking and make the world a better place. So, what do you say, @elonmusk? Let's open up the doors and share our knowledge with the world! 🚀💡\n(Written by OpenChat 3.5, with a touch of humor and wit.)\nLicense # Param Average MMLU HumanEval MATH GSM8k\nOpenChat 3.5 Apache-2.0 7B 56.4 64.3 55.5 28.6 77.3\nGrok-0 Proprietary 33B 44.5 65.7 39.7 15.7 56.8\nGrok-1 Proprietary ? 55.8 73 63.2 23.9 62.9\nBenchmarks\nModel # Params Average MT-Bench AGIEval BBH MC TruthfulQA MMLU HumanEval BBH CoT GSM8K\nOpenChat-3.5 7B 61.6 7.81 47.4 47.6 59.1 64.3 55.5 63.5 77.3\nChatGPT (March)* ? 61.5 7.94 47.1 47.6 57.7 67.3 48.1 70.1 74.9\nOpenHermes 2.5 7B 59.3 7.54 46.5 49.4 57.5 63.8 48.2 59.9 73.5\nOpenOrca Mistral 7B 52.7 6.86 42.9 49.4 45.9 59.3 38.4 58.1 59.1\nZephyr-β^ 7B 34.6 7.34 39.0 40.6 40.8 39.8 22.0 16.0 5.1\nMistral 7B - 6.84 38.0 39.0 - 60.1 30.5 - 52.2\nOpen-source SOTA** 13B-70B 61.4 7.71 41.7 49.7 62.3 63.7 73.2 41.4 82.3\nWizardLM 70B Orca 13B Orca 13B Platypus2 70B WizardLM 70B WizardCoder 34B Flan-T5 11B MetaMath 70B\n*: ChatGPT (March) results are from GPT-4 Technical Report, Chain-of-Thought Hub, and our evaluation. Please note that ChatGPT is not a fixed baseline and evolves rapidly over time.\n^: Zephyr-β often fails to follow few-shot CoT instructions, likely because it was aligned with only chat data but not trained on few-shot data.\n**: Mistral and Open-source SOTA results are taken from reported results in instruction-tuned model papers and official repositories.\nAll models are evaluated in chat mode (e.g. with the respective conversation template applied). All zero-shot benchmarks follow the same setting as in the AGIEval paper and Orca paper. CoT tasks use the same configuration as Chain-of-Thought Hub, HumanEval is evaluated with EvalPlus, and MT-bench is run using FastChat. To reproduce our results, follow the instructions in our repository.\nLimitations\nFoundation Model Limitations Despite its advanced capabilities, OpenChat is still bound by the limitations inherent in its foundation models. These limitations may impact the model's performance in areas such as:\nComplex reasoning\nMathematical and arithmetic tasks\nProgramming and coding challenges\nHallucination of Non-existent Information OpenChat may sometimes generate information that does not exist or is not accurate, also known as \"hallucination\". Users should be aware of this possibility and verify any critical information obtained from the model.\nSafety OpenChat may sometimes generate harmful, hate speech, biased responses, or answer unsafe questions. It's crucial to apply additional AI safety measures in use cases that require safe and moderated responses.\nLicense\nOur OpenChat 3.5 code and models are distributed under the Apache License 2.0.\nDataset Details\nOpenChat 3.5 was trained with C-RLFT on a collection of publicly available high-quality instruction data, with a custom processing pipeline.

If layers are offloaded to the GPU, this will reduce RAM usage and use VRAM instead.\nHow to download GGUF files\nNote for manual downloaders: You almost never want to clone the entire repo! Multiple different quantisation formats are provided, and most users only want to pick and download a single file.\nThe following clients/libraries will automatically download models for you, providing a list of available models to choose from:\nLM Studio\nLoLLMS Web UI\nFaraday.dev\nIn text-generation-webui\nUnder Download Model, you can enter the model repo: TheBloke/dolphin-2.5-mixtral-8x7b-GGUF and below it, a specific filename to download, such as: dolphin-2.5-mixtral-8x7b.Q4_K_M.gguf.\nThen click Download.\nOn the command line, including multiple files at once\nI recommend using the huggingface-hub Python library:\npip3 install huggingface-hub\nThen you can download any individual model file to the current directory, at high speed, with a command like this:\nhuggingface-cli download TheBloke/dolphin-2.5-mixtral-8x7b-GGUF dolphin-2.5-mixtral-8x7b.Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False\nMore advanced huggingface-cli download usage (click to read)\nExample llama.cpp command\nMake sure you are using llama.cpp from commit d0cee0d or later.\n./main -ngl 35 -m dolphin-2.5-mixtral-8x7b.Q4_K_M.gguf --color -c 32768 --temp 0.7 --repeat_penalty 1.1 -n -1 -p \"<|im_start|>system\\n{system_message}<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\n{prompt}<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\"\nChange -ngl 32 to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Remove it if you don't have GPU acceleration.\nChange -c 32768 to the desired sequence length. For extended sequence models - eg 8K, 16K, 32K - the necessary RoPE scaling parameters are read from the GGUF file and set by llama.cpp automatically. Note that longer sequence lengths require much more resources, so you may need to reduce this value.\nIf you want to have a chat-style conversation, replace the -p <PROMPT> argument with -i -ins\nFor other parameters and how to use them, please refer to the llama.cpp documentation\nHow to run in text-generation-webui\nNote that text-generation-webui may not yet be compatible with Mixtral GGUFs. Please check compatibility first.\nFurther instructions can be found in the text-generation-webui documentation, here: text-generation-webui/docs/04 ‐ Model Tab.md.\nHow to run from Python code\nYou can use GGUF models from Python using the llama-cpp-python version 0.2.23 and later.\nHow to load this model in Python code, using llama-cpp-python\nFor full documentation, please see: llama-cpp-python docs.\nFirst install the package\nRun one of the following commands, according to your system:\n# Base ctransformers with no GPU acceleration\npip install llama-cpp-python\n# With NVidia CUDA acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with OpenBLAS acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_BLAS=ON -DLLAMA_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with CLBLast acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_CLBLAST=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with AMD ROCm GPU acceleration (Linux only)\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_HIPBLAS=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with Metal GPU acceleration for macOS systems only\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_METAL=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n\n# In windows, to set the variables CMAKE_ARGS in PowerShell, follow this format; eg for NVidia CUDA:\n$env:CMAKE_ARGS = \"-DLLAMA_OPENBLAS=on\"\npip install llama-cpp-python\nSimple llama-cpp-python example code\nfrom llama_cpp import Llama\n\n# Set gpu_layers to the number of layers to offload to GPU.

We used the pretrained microsoft/mpnet-base model and fine-tuned in on a 1B sentence pairs dataset. We use a contrastive learning objective: given a sentence from the pair, the model should predict which out of a set of randomly sampled other sentences, was actually paired with it in our dataset.\nWe developped this model during the Community week using JAX/Flax for NLP & CV, organized by Hugging Face. We developped this model as part of the project: Train the Best Sentence Embedding Model Ever with 1B Training Pairs. We benefited from efficient hardware infrastructure to run the project: 7 TPUs v3-8, as well as intervention from Googles Flax, JAX, and Cloud team member about efficient deep learning frameworks.\nIntended uses\nOur model is intented to be used as a sentence and short paragraph encoder. Given an input text, it ouptuts a vector which captures the semantic information. The sentence vector may be used for information retrieval, clustering or sentence similarity tasks.\nBy default, input text longer than 384 word pieces is truncated.\nTraining procedure\nPre-training\nWe use the pretrained microsoft/mpnet-base model. Please refer to the model card for more detailed information about the pre-training procedure.\nFine-tuning\nWe fine-tune the model using a contrastive objective. Formally, we compute the cosine similarity from each possible sentence pairs from the batch. We then apply the cross entropy loss by comparing with true pairs.\nHyper parameters\nWe trained ou model on a TPU v3-8. We train the model during 100k steps using a batch size of 1024 (128 per TPU core). We use a learning rate warm up of 500. The sequence length was limited to 128 tokens. We used the AdamW optimizer with a 2e-5 learning rate. The full training script is accessible in this current repository: train_script.py.\nTraining data\nWe use the concatenation from multiple datasets to fine-tune our model. The total number of sentence pairs is above 1 billion sentences. We sampled each dataset given a weighted probability which configuration is detailed in the data_config.json file.\nDataset Paper Number of training tuples\nReddit comments (2015-2018) paper 726,484,430\nS2ORC Citation pairs (Abstracts) paper 116,288,806\nWikiAnswers Duplicate question pairs paper 77,427,422\nPAQ (Question, Answer) pairs paper 64,371,441\nS2ORC Citation pairs (Titles) paper 52,603,982\nS2ORC (Title, Abstract) paper 41,769,185\nStack Exchange (Title, Body) pairs - 25,316,456\nStack Exchange (Title+Body, Answer) pairs - 21,396,559\nStack Exchange (Title, Answer) pairs - 21,396,559\nMS MARCO triplets paper 9,144,553\nGOOAQ: Open Question Answering with Diverse Answer Types paper 3,012,496\nYahoo Answers (Title, Answer) paper 1,198,260\nCode Search - 1,151,414\nCOCO Image captions paper 828,395\nSPECTER citation triplets paper 684,100\nYahoo Answers (Question, Answer) paper 681,164\nYahoo Answers (Title, Question) paper 659,896\nSearchQA paper 582,261\nEli5 paper 325,475\nFlickr 30k paper 317,695\nStack Exchange Duplicate questions (titles) 304,525\nAllNLI (SNLI and MultiNLI paper SNLI, paper MultiNLI 277,230\nStack Exchange Duplicate questions (bodies) 250,519\nStack Exchange Duplicate questions (titles+bodies) 250,460\nSentence Compression paper 180,000\nWikihow paper 128,542\nAltlex paper 112,696\nQuora Question Triplets - 103,663\nSimple Wikipedia paper 102,225\nNatural Questions (NQ) paper 100,231\nSQuAD2.0 paper 87,599\nTriviaQA - 73,346\nTotal 1,170,060,424",
    "https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-turbo": "SD-Turbo Model Card\nSD-Turbo is a fast generative text-to-image model that can synthesize photorealistic images from a text prompt in a single network evaluation. We release SD-Turbo as a research artifact, and to study small, distilled text-to-image models. For increased quality and prompt understanding, we recommend SDXL-Turbo.\nModel Details\nModel Description\nSD-Turbo is a distilled version of Stable Diffusion 2.1, trained for real-time synthesis. SD-Turbo is based on a novel training method called Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD) (see the technical report), which allows sampling large-scale foundational image diffusion models in 1 to 4 steps at high image quality. This approach uses score distillation to leverage large-scale off-the-shelf image diffusion models as a teacher signal and combines this with an adversarial loss to ensure high image fidelity even in the low-step regime of one or two sampling steps.\nDeveloped by: Stability AI\nFunded by: Stability AI\nModel type: Generative text-to-image model\nFinetuned from model: Stable Diffusion 2.1\nModel Sources\nFor research purposes, we recommend our generative-models Github repository (https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models), which implements the most popular diffusion frameworks (both training and inference).\nRepository: https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models\nPaper: https://stability.ai/research/adversarial-diffusion-distillation\nDemo [for the bigger SDXL-Turbo]: http://clipdrop.co/stable-diffusion-turbo\nEvaluation\nThe charts above evaluate user preference for SD-Turbo over other single- and multi-step models. SD-Turbo evaluated at a single step is preferred by human voters in terms of image quality and prompt following over LCM-Lora XL and LCM-Lora 1.5.\nNote: For increased quality, we recommend the bigger version SDXL-Turbo. For details on the user study, we refer to the research paper.\nUses\nDirect Use\nThe model is intended for research purposes only. Possible research areas and tasks include\nResearch on generative models.\nResearch on real-time applications of generative models.\nResearch on the impact of real-time generative models.\nSafe deployment of models which have the potential to generate harmful content.\nProbing and understanding the limitations and biases of generative models.\nGeneration of artworks and use in design and other artistic processes.\nApplications in educational or creative tools.\nExcluded uses are described below.\nDiffusers\npip install diffusers transformers accelerate --upgrade\nText-to-image:\nSD-Turbo does not make use of guidance_scale or negative_prompt, we disable it with guidance_scale=0.0. Preferably, the model generates images of size 512x512 but higher image sizes work as well. A single step is enough to generate high quality images.\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image\nimport torch\n\npipe = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from_pretrained(\"stabilityai/sd-turbo\", torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant=\"fp16\")\npipe.to(\"cuda\")\n\nprompt = \"A cinematic shot of a baby racoon wearing an intricate italian priest robe.\"\nimage = pipe(prompt=prompt, num_inference_steps=1, guidance_scale=0.0).images[0]\nImage-to-image:\nWhen using SD-Turbo for image-to-image generation, make sure that num_inference_steps * strength is larger or equal to 1. The image-to-image pipeline will run for int(num_inference_steps * strength) steps, e.g. 0.5 * 2.0 = 1 step in our example below.\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForImage2Image\nfrom diffusers.utils import load_image\nimport torch\n\npipe = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from_pretrained(\"stabilityai/sd-turbo\", torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant=\"fp16\")\npipe.to(\"cuda\")\n\ninit_image = load_image(\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/cat.png\").resize((512, 512))\nprompt = \"cat wizard, gandalf, lord of the rings, detailed, fantasy, cute, adorable, Pixar, Disney, 8k\"\n\nimage = pipe(prompt, image=init_image, num_inference_steps=2, strength=0.5, guidance_scale=0.0).images[0]\nOut-of-Scope Use\nThe model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model. The model should not be used in any way that violates Stability AI's Acceptable Use Policy.\nLimitations and Bias\nLimitations\nThe quality and prompt alignment is lower than that of SDXL-Turbo.\nThe generated images are of a fixed resolution (512x512 pix), and the model does not achieve perfect photorealism.\nThe model cannot render legible text.\nFaces and people in general may not be generated properly.\nThe autoencoding part of the model is lossy.\nRecommendations\nThe model is intended for research purposes only.\nHow to Get Started with the Model\nCheck out https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models",

This is the repository for the 7B fine-tuned model, optimized for dialogue use cases and converted for the Hugging Face Transformers format. Links to other models can be found in the index at the bottom.\nModel Details\nNote: Use of this model is governed by the Meta license. In order to download the model weights and tokenizer, please visit the website and accept our License before requesting access here.\nMeta developed and publicly released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.\nModel Developers Meta\nVariations Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes — 7B, 13B, and 70B — as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.\nInput Models input text only.\nOutput Models generate text only.\nModel Architecture Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\nTraining Data Params Content Length GQA Tokens LR\nLlama 2 A new mix of publicly available online data 7B 4k ✗ 2.0T 3.0 x 10-4\nLlama 2 A new mix of publicly available online data 13B 4k ✗ 2.0T 3.0 x 10-4\nLlama 2 A new mix of publicly available online data 70B 4k ✔ 2.0T 1.5 x 10-4\nLlama 2 family of models. Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. Bigger models - 70B -- use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\nModel Dates Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.\nStatus This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\nLicense A custom commercial license is available at: https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/\nResearch Paper \"Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models\"\nIntended Use\nIntended Use Cases Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\nTo get the expected features and performance for the chat versions, a specific formatting needs to be followed, including the INST and <<SYS>> tags, BOS and EOS tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling strip() on inputs to avoid double-spaces). See our reference code in github for details: chat_completion.\nOut-of-scope Uses Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws).Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Llama 2.\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research Super Cluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\nCarbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\nTime (GPU hours) Power Consumption (W) Carbon Emitted(tCO2eq)\nLlama 2 7B 184320 400 31.22\nLlama 2 13B 368640 400 62.44\nLlama 2 70B 1720320 400 291.42\nTotal 3311616 539.00\nCO2 emissions during pretraining. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\nTraining Data\nOverview Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over one million new human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\nData Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is more recent, up to July 2023.\nEvaluation Results\nIn this section, we report the results for the Llama 1 and Llama 2 models on standard academic benchmarks.For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.\nModel Size Code Commonsense Reasoning World Knowledge Reading Comprehension Math MMLU BBH AGI Eval\nLlama 1 7B 14.1 60.8 46.2 58.5 6.95 35.1 30.3 23.9\nLlama 1 13B 18.9 66.1 52.6 62.3 10.9 46.9 37.0 33.9\nLlama 1 33B 26.0 70.0 58.4 67.6 21.4 57.8 39.8 41.7\nLlama 1 65B 30.7 70.7 60.5 68.6 30.8 63.4 43.5 47.6\nLlama 2 7B 16.8 63.9 48.9 61.3 14.6 45.3 32.6 29.3\nLlama 2 13B 24.5 66.9 55.4 65.8 28.7 54.8 39.4 39.1\nLlama 2 70B 37.5 71.9 63.6 69.4 35.2 68.9 51.2 54.2\nOverall performance on grouped academic benchmarks. Code: We report the average pass@1 scores of our models on HumanEval and MBPP. Commonsense Reasoning: We report the average of PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC easy and challenge, OpenBookQA, and CommonsenseQA. We report 7-shot results for CommonSenseQA and 0-shot results for all other benchmarks. World Knowledge: We evaluate the 5-shot performance on NaturalQuestions and TriviaQA and report the average. Reading Comprehension: For reading comprehension, we report the 0-shot average on SQuAD, QuAC, and BoolQ. MATH: We report the average of the GSM8K (8 shot) and MATH (4 shot) benchmarks at top 1.\nTruthfulQA Toxigen\nLlama 1 7B 27.42 23.00\nLlama 1 13B 41.74 23.08\nLlama 1 33B 44.19 22.57\nLlama 1 65B 48.71 21.77\nLlama 2 7B 33.29 21.25\nLlama 2 13B 41.86 26.10\nLlama 2 70B 50.18 24.60\nEvaluation of pretrained LLMs on automatic safety benchmarks.

Same metric definitions as above.\nEthical Considerations and Limitations\nLlama 2 is a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/\nReporting Issues\nPlease report any software “bug,” or other problems with the models through one of the following means:\nReporting issues with the model: github.com/facebookresearch/llama\nReporting problematic content generated by the model: developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback\nReporting bugs and security concerns: facebook.com/whitehat/info\nLlama Model Index\nModel Llama2 Llama2-hf Llama2-chat Llama2-chat-hf\n7B Link Link Link Link\n13B Link Link Link Link\n70B Link Link Link Link",

Recently, the LlamaIndex Blog has evaluated the popular embedding and reranker models in RAG pipeline and attract great attention. Now, we follow its pipeline to evaluate our BCEmbedding.\nLlamaIndex是一个著名的大模型应用的开源工具，在RAG中很受欢迎。最近，LlamaIndex博客对市面上常用的embedding和reranker模型进行RAG流程的评测，吸引广泛关注。下面我们按照该评测流程验证BCEmbedding在RAG中的效果。\nFirst, install LlamaIndex:\npip install llama-index==0.9.22\n1. Metrics Definition\nHit Rate:\nHit rate calculates the fraction of queries where the correct answer is found within the top-k retrieved documents. In simpler terms, it's about how often our system gets it right within the top few guesses. The larger, the better.\nMean Reciprocal Rank (MRR):\nFor each query, MRR evaluates the system's accuracy by looking at the rank of the highest-placed relevant document. Specifically, it's the average of the reciprocals of these ranks across all the queries. So, if the first relevant document is the top result, the reciprocal rank is 1; if it's second, the reciprocal rank is 1/2, and so on. The larger, the better.\n命中率（Hit Rate）\n命中率计算的是在检索的前k个文档中找到正确答案的查询所占的比例。简单来说，它反映了我们的系统在前几次猜测中答对的频率。该指标越大越好。\n平均倒数排名（Mean Reciprocal Rank，MRR）\n对于每个查询，MRR通过查看最高排名的相关文档的排名来评估系统的准确性。具体来说，它是在所有查询中这些排名的倒数的平均值。因此，如果第一个相关文档是排名最靠前的结果，倒数排名就是1；如果是第二个，倒数排名就是1/2，依此类推。该指标越大越好。\n2. Reproduce LlamaIndex Blog\nIn order to compare our BCEmbedding with other embedding and reranker models fairly, we provide a one-click script to reproduce results of the LlamaIndex Blog, including our BCEmbedding:\n为了公平起见，运行下面脚本，复现LlamaIndex博客的结果，将BCEmbedding与其他embedding和reranker模型进行对比分析：\n# There should be two GPUs available at least.\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python BCEmbedding/tools/eval_rag/eval_llamaindex_reproduce.py\nThen, sumarize the evaluation results by:\npython BCEmbedding/tools/eval_rag/summarize_eval_results.py --results_dir results/rag_reproduce_results\nResults Reproduced from the LlamaIndex Blog can be checked in Reproduced Summary of RAG Evaluation, with some obvious conclusions:\nIn WithoutReranker setting, our bce-embedding-base_v1 outperforms all the other embedding models.\nWith fixing the embedding model, our bce-reranker-base_v1 achieves the best performence.\nThe combination of bce-embedding-base_v1 and bce-reranker-base_v1 is SOTA.\n输出的指标汇总详见 ***LlamaIndex RAG评测结果复现***。从该复现结果中，可以看出：\n在WithoutReranker设置下（竖排对比），bce-embedding-base_v1比其他embedding模型效果都要好。\n在固定embedding模型设置下，对比不同reranker效果（横排对比），bce-reranker-base_v1比其他reranker模型效果都要好。\nbce-embedding-base_v1和bce-reranker-base_v1组合，表现SOTA。\n3. Broad Domain Adaptability\nThe evaluation of LlamaIndex Blog is monolingual, small amount of data, and specific domain (just including \"llama2\" paper). In order to evaluate the broad domain adaptability, bilingual and crosslingual capability, we follow the blog to build a multiple domains evaluation dataset (includding \"Computer Science\", \"Physics\", \"Biology\", \"Economics\", \"Math\", and \"Quantitative Finance\"), named CrosslingualMultiDomainsDataset, by OpenAI gpt-4-1106-preview for high quality.\n在上述的LlamaIndex博客的评测数据只用了“llama2”这一篇文章，该评测是 单语种，小数据量，特定领域 的。为了兼容更真实更广的用户使用场景，评测算法模型的 领域泛化性，双语和跨语种能力，我们按照该博客的方法构建了一个多领域（计算机科学，物理学，生物学，经济学，数学，量化金融等）的双语种、跨语种评测数据，CrosslingualMultiDomainsDataset。为了保证构建数据的高质量，我们采用OpenAI的gpt-4-1106-preview。\nFirst, run following cmd to evaluate the most popular and powerful embedding and reranker models:\n# There should be two GPUs available at least.\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python BCEmbedding/tools/eval_rag/eval_llamaindex_multiple_domains.py\nThen, run the following script to sumarize the evaluation results:\npython BCEmbedding/tools/eval_rag/summarize_eval_results.py --results_dir results/rag_results\nThe summary of multiple domains evaluations can be seen in Multiple Domains Scenarios.\n📈 Leaderboard\nSemantic Representation Evaluations in MTEB\n1.

Let's choose the problem \"Find Largest Submatrix with All Ones\" from LeetCode.\n\nHere is the problem statement:\nGiven a boolean 2D matrix where each row is sorted in non-decreasing order and all columns are also sorted in non-decreasing order, find\nthe largest submatrix that contains only ones.\n\nHere is the solution in Kotlin:\n\nfun largestSubmatrix(matrix: Array<IntArray>): Int {\n    if (matrix.isEmpty()) return 0\n\n    val rows = matrix.size\n    val cols = matrix[0].size\n\n    // initialize dynamic programming array with all zeros\n    val dp = Array(rows) { IntArray(cols) }\n\n    // iterate through each column in the matrix\n    for (c in 0 until cols) {\n        for (r in 0 until rows) {\n            // if current cell is one, update dp value with min of row and dp[r - 1][c]\n            if (matrix[r][c] == 1) {\n                dp[r][c] = r.coerceAtMost(dp[r - 1][c] + 1)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // find the maximum value in the dp array\n    var maxArea = 0\n    for (r in 0 until rows) {\n        for (c in 0 until cols) {\n            if (dp[r][c] != 0) {\n                val area = dp[r][c] * (cols - c)\n                maxArea = maxOf(maxArea, area)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return maxArea\n}\nThis function takes a 2D boolean matrix as input and returns the size of the largest submatrix with all ones. The algorithm uses dynamic\nprogramming to keep track of the width of the current row for every column. Then it updates the maximum size of the submatrix by\nconsidering each row in the matrix.\nFuture Plans\nDolphin 3.0 dataset is in progress, and will include:\nenhanced general chat use-cases\nenhanced structured output\nenhanced Agent cases like Autogen, Memgpt, Functions\nenhanced role-playing\nIf you would like to financially support my efforts\nswag",

It was established on October 1st, 1890 and covers an area of approximately 747,956 acres (302,687 hectares). The park boasts some of America's most iconic natural wonders such as Yosemite Valley, Half Dome, El Capitan, Bridalveil Fall, Tuolumne Meadows, Glacier Point, Mariposa Grove, and many more breathtaking landscapes that attract millions of visitors each year.\n\nThe history of Yosemite dates back to over seven million years ago when glaciers carved out its stunning granite cliffs and valleys. Native American tribes like Miwok and Paiute have lived here for thousands of years before European explorers arrived during the mid-nineteenth century. In fact, it was John Muir - one of America’s greatest conservationists who helped establish this region as a protected wilderness area by advocating for its preservation through his writings and activism.\n\nToday, Yosemite offers various recreational activities including hiking, rock climbing, camping, fishing, horseback riding, wildlife watching, photography, and winter sports like skiing and snowshoeing. Visitors can also enjoy ranger programs, guided tours, educational exhibits at visitor centers, or simply take time to appreciate nature while strolling along scenic trails surrounded by towering sequoia trees, cascading waterfalls, and crystal clear lakes.\n\nIn addition to preserving these awe-inspiring vistas, Yosemite plays a crucial role in protecting numerous plant and animal species found within its boundaries. Some notable inhabitants include black bears, mountain lions, mule deer, coyotes, bobcats, golden eagles, peregrine falcons, bighorn sheep, and several types of fish native to the Merced River which runs through the heart of the valley.\n\nAs we continue our journey into the future, let us remember the importance of safeguarding places like Yosemite so they may remain pristine sanctuaries where both humans and animals alike can thrive together amidst unspoiled beauty.</s>\nplease input prompt:李开复是谁？\n李开复是谁？\n他是一个在人工智能领域有着卓越贡献的科学家，也是一位成功的企业家。他的名字与谷歌、微软等科技巨头紧密相连，他是创新工场的创始人之一，更是无数创业者心中的偶像和导师。然而，除了这些耀眼的光环之外，李开复还有着怎样的故事呢？让我们一起来揭秘这位传奇人物的人生历程吧！</s>",

    "https://huggingface.co/sentinet/suicidality": "Advanced Suicidality Classifier Model\nIntroduction\nWelcome to the Suicidality Detection AI Model! This project aims to provide a machine learning solution for detecting sequences of words indicative of suicidality in text. By utilizing the ELECTRA architecture and fine-tuning on a diverse dataset, we have created a powerful classification model that can distinguish between suicidal and non-suicidal text expressions.\nLabels\nThe model classifies input text into two labels:\nLABEL_0: Indicates that the text is non-suicidal.\nLABEL_1: Indicates that the text is indicative of suicidality.\nTraining\nThe model was fine-tuned using the ELECTRA architecture on a carefully curated dataset. Our training process involved cleaning and preprocessing various text sources to create a comprehensive training set. The training results indicate promising performance, with metrics including:\nPerformance\nThe model's performance on the validation dataset is as follows:\nAccuracy: 0.939432\nRecall: 0.937164\nPrecision: 0.92822\nF1 Score: 0.932672\nThese metrics demonstrate the model's ability to accurately classify sequences of text as either indicative of suicidality or non-suicidal.\nData Sources\nWe collected data from multiple sources to create a rich and diverse training dataset:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/c-ssrs-labeled-suicidality-in-500-anonymized-red\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amangoyl/reddit-dataset-for-multi-task-nlp\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imeshsonu/suicideal-phrases\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/laxmimerit/twitter-suicidal-intention-dataset/master/twitter-suicidal_data.csv\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohanedmashaly/suicide-notes\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/natalialech/suicidal-ideation-on-twitter\nThe data underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing before being used for training the model.\nHow to Use\nInstallation\nTo use the model, you need to install the Transformers library:\npip install transformers\nUsing the Model\nYou can utilize the model for text classification using the following code snippets:\nUsing the pipeline approach:\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nclassifier = pipeline(\"sentiment-analysis\", model=\"sentinetyd/suicidality\")\n\nresult = classifier(\"text to classify\")\nprint(result)\nUsing the tokenizer and model programmatically:\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"sentinetyd/suicidality\")\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"sentinetyd/suicidality\")\n\n# Perform tokenization and prediction using the tokenizer and model\nEthical Considerations\nSuicidality is a sensitive and serious topic. It's important to exercise caution and consider ethical implications when using this model. Predictions made by the model should be handled with care and used to complement human judgment and intervention.\nModel Credits\nWe would like to acknowledge the \"gooohjy/suicidal-electra\" model available on Hugging Face's model repository. You can find the model at this link. We used this model as a starting point and fine-tuned it to create our specialized suicidality detection model.\nContributions\nWe welcome contributions and feedback from the community to further improve the model's performance, enhance the dataset, and ensure its responsible deployment.",

    "https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Orca-2-13b": "Orca 2\nOrca 2 is built for research purposes only and provides a single turn response in tasks such as reasoning over user given data, reading comprehension, math problem solving and text summarization. The model is designed to excel particularly in reasoning.\nNote that:\nThis is a research model, intended to show that we can use capable models and complex workflows (advanced prompts, multiple calls) to create synthetic data that can teach Small Language Models (SLMs) new capabilities. We chose reasoning because it is a widely useful capability that SLMs lack.\nThe model is not optimized for chat and has not been trained with RLHF or DPO. It is best used after being finetuned for chat or for a specific task.\nBeyond reasoning, the model inherits capabilities and limitations of its base (LLAMA-2 base). We have already seen that the benefits of the Orca training can be applied to other base model too.\nWe make Orca 2's weights publicly available to support further research on the development, evaluation, and alignment of SLMs.\nWhat is Orca 2’s intended use(s)?\nOrca 2 is built for research purposes only.\nThe main purpose is to allow the research community to assess its abilities and to provide a foundation for building better frontier models.\nHow was Orca 2 evaluated?\nOrca 2 has been evaluated on a large number of tasks ranging from reasoning to grounding and safety. Please refer to Section 6 and Appendix in the Orca 2 paper for details on evaluations.\nModel Details\nOrca 2 is a finetuned version of LLAMA-2. Orca 2’s training data is a synthetic dataset that was created to enhance the small model’s reasoning abilities. All synthetic training data was moderated using the Microsoft Azure content filters. More details about the model can be found in the Orca 2 paper.\nPlease refer to LLaMA-2 technical report for details on the model architecture.\nLicense\nOrca 2 is licensed under the Microsoft Research License.\nLlama 2 is licensed under the LLAMA 2 Community License, Copyright © Meta Platforms, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\nBias, Risks, and Limitations\nOrca 2, built upon the LLaMA 2 model family, retains many of its limitations, as well as the common limitations of other large language models or limitation caused by its training process, including:\nData Biases: Large language models, trained on extensive data, can inadvertently carry biases present in the source data. Consequently, the models may generate outputs that could be potentially biased or unfair.\nLack of Contextual Understanding: Despite their impressive capabilities in language understanding and generation, these models exhibit limited real-world understanding, resulting in potential inaccuracies or nonsensical responses.\nLack of Transparency: Due to the complexity and size, large language models can act as “black boxes”, making it difficult to comprehend the rationale behind specific outputs or decisions. We recommend reviewing transparency notes from Azure for more information.\nContent Harms: There are various types of content harms that large language models can cause. It is important to be aware of them when using these models, and to take actions to prevent them. It is recommended to leverage various content moderation services provided by different companies and institutions. On an important note, we hope for better regulations and standards from government and technology leaders around content harms for AI technologies in future. We value and acknowledge the important role that research and open source community can play in this direction.\nHallucination: It is important to be aware and cautious not to entirely rely on a given language model for critical decisions or information that might have deep impact as it is not obvious how to prevent these models from fabricating content. Moreover, it is not clear whether small models may be more susceptible to hallucination in ungrounded generation use cases due to their smaller sizes and hence reduced memorization capacities. This is an active research topic and we hope there will be more rigorous measurement, understanding and mitigations around this topic.\nPotential for Misuse: Without suitable safeguards, there is a risk that these models could be maliciously used for generating disinformation or harmful content.\nData Distribution: Orca 2’s performance is likely to correlate strongly with the distribution of the tuning data. This correlation might limit its accuracy in areas underrepresented in the training dataset such as math, coding, and reasoning.\nSystem messages: Orca 2 demonstrates variance in performance depending on the system instructions. Additionally, the stochasticity introduced by the model size may lead to generation of non-deterministic responses to different system instructions.\nZero-Shot Settings: Orca 2 was trained on data that mostly simulate zero-shot settings. While the model demonstrate very strong performance in zero-shot settings, it does not show the same gains of using few-shot learning compared to other, specially larger, models.\nSynthetic data: As Orca 2 is trained on synthetic data, it could inherit both the advantages and shortcomings of the models and methods used for data generation. We posit that Orca 2 benefits from the safety measures incorporated during training and safety guardrails (e.g., content filter) within the Azure OpenAI API. However, detailed studies are required for better quantification of such risks.\nThis model is solely designed for research settings, and its testing has only been carried out in such environments. It should not be used in downstream applications, as additional analysis is needed to assess potential harm or bias in the proposed application.\nGetting started with Orca 2\nInference with Hugging Face library\nimport torch\nimport transformers\n\nif torch.cuda.is_available():\n    torch.set_default_device(\"cuda\")\nelse:\n    torch.set_default_device(\"cpu\")\n    \nmodel = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/Orca-2-13b\", device_map='auto')\n\n# https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/27132\n# please use the slow tokenizer since fast and slow tokenizer produces different tokens\ntokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\n        \"microsoft/Orca-2-13b\",\n        use_fast=False,\n    )\n\nsystem_message = \"You are Orca, an AI language model created by Microsoft.

    "https://huggingface.co/DiffusionLight/DiffusionLight": "DiffusionLight: Light Probes for Free by Painting a Chrome Ball\nProject Page | Paper | Github | Colab\nWe present a simple yet effective technique to estimate lighting in a single input image. Current techniques rely heavily on HDR panorama datasets to train neural networks to regress an input with limited field-of-view to a full environment map. However, these approaches often struggle with real-world, uncontrolled settings due to the limited diversity and size of their datasets. To address this problem, we leverage diffusion models trained on billions of standard images to render a chrome ball into the input image. Despite its simplicity, this task remains challenging: the diffusion models often insert incorrect or inconsistent objects and cannot readily generate images in HDR format. Our research uncovers a surprising relationship between the appearance of chrome balls and the initial diffusion noise map, which we utilize to consistently generate high-quality chrome balls. We further fine-tune an LDR difusion model (Stable Diffusion XL) with LoRA, enabling it to perform exposure bracketing for HDR light estimation. Our method produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios.\nUsage\nWe recommend checking out Github Repository: https://github.com/DiffusionLight/DiffusionLight, which provides code for estimating light from any image.

It was introduced in the paper BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension by Lewis et al. and first released in [this repository (https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/bart).\nDisclaimer: The team releasing BART did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\nModel description\nBART is a transformer encoder-encoder (seq2seq) model with a bidirectional (BERT-like) encoder and an autoregressive (GPT-like) decoder. BART is pre-trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text.\nBART is particularly effective when fine-tuned for text generation (e.g. summarization, translation) but also works well for comprehension tasks (e.g. text classification, question answering).

Then, Barrientos declared \"I do\" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other.\nIn 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her \"first and only\" marriage.\nBarrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of \"offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree,\" referring to her false statements on the\n2010 marriage license application, according to court documents.\nProsecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam.\nOn Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further.\nAfter leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective\nAnnette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002.\nAll occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx. She is believed to still be married to four men, and at one time, she was married to eight men at once, prosecutors say.\nProsecutors said the immigration scam involved some of her husbands, who filed for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages.\nAny divorces happened only after such filings were approved. It was unclear whether any of the men will be prosecuted.\nThe case was referred to the Bronx District Attorney\\'s Office by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security\\'s\nInvestigation Division. Seven of the men are from so-called \"red-flagged\" countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan and Mali.\nHer eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, was deported in 2006 to his native Pakistan after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.\nIf convicted, Barrientos faces up to four years in prison.

There are also three variant models based on the AOM3 that have been adjusted to a unique illustration style. These models will help you to express your ideas more clearly.\n▼Links\n[⚠NSFW] Civitai: AbyssOrangeMix3 (AOM3) | Stable Diffusion Checkpoint | https://civitai.com/models/9942/abyssorangemix3-aom3\nAbout\nFeatures: high-quality, realistic textured illustrations can be generated.\nThere are two major changes from AOM2.\n1: Models for NSFW such as _nsfw and _hard have been improved: the models after nsfw in AOM2 generated creepy realistic faces, muscles and ribs when using Hires.fix, even though they were animated characters. These have all been improved in AOM3.\ne.g.: explanatory diagram by MEME : GO TO MEME ZONE↓\n2: sfw/nsfw merged into one model. Originally, nsfw models were separated because adding NSFW content (models like NAI and gape) would change the face and cause the aforementioned problems. Now that those have been improved, the models can be packed into one.\nIn addition, thanks to excellent extensions such as ModelToolkit, the model file size could be reduced (1.98 GB per model).\nMore feature\nIn addition, these U-Net Blocks Weight Merge models take numerous steps but are carefully merged to ensure that mutual content is not overwritten.\n(Of course, all models allow full control over adult content.)\n🔐 When generating illustrations for the general public: write \"nsfw\" in the negative prompt field\n🔞 When generating adult illustrations: \"nsfw\" in the positive prompt field -> It can be generated without putting it in. If you include it, the atmosphere will be more NSFW.\nVariations / Sample Gallery\n🚧Editing🚧\nAOM3\n▼AOM3\n(Actually, this gallery doesn't make much sense since AOM3 is mainly an improvement of the NSFW part 😂 ...But we can confirm that the picture is not much different from AOM2sfw.)\nAOM3A1\n⛔Only this model (AOM3A1) includes ChilloutMix.

In fact, this is mostly due to the work of Counterfeit 2.5, but the textures are more realistic thanks to the U-Net Blocks Weight Merge.\nAOM3A3\n🚧Editing🚧 Features: Midpoint of artistic and kawaii. the model has been tuned to combine realistic textures, a artistic style that also feels like an oil colour style, and a cute anime-style face. Can be used to create a wide range of illustrations.\nAOM3A1B\nAOM3A1B added. This model is my latest favorite. I recommend it for its moderate realism, moderate brush touch, and moderate LoRA conformity.\nThe model was merged by mistakenly selecting 'Add sum' when 'Add differences' should have been selected in the AOM3A3AOM3A2 recipe. It was an unintended merge, but we share it because the illustrations produced are consistently good results.\nThe model was merged by mistakenly selecting 'Add sum' when 'Add differences' should have been selected in the AOM3A3AOM3A2 recipe.

However, the faces and compositions are not an exact match to AOM2sfw.AOM2sfw is sometimes superior when generating SFW content. I recommend choosing according to the intended use of the illustration.See below for a comparison between AOM2sfw and AOM3.\n▼A summary of the AOM3 work is as follows\ninvestigated the impact of the NAI and gape layers as AOM2 _nsfw onwards is crap.\ncut face layer: OUT04 because I want realistic faces to stop → Failed.

It can generate elaborate and detailed illustrations that cannot be drawn by hand. It can also be used for a variety of purposes, making it extremely useful for design and artwork. Furthermore, it provides an unparalleled new means of expression. It can generate illustrations in a variety of genres to meet a wide range of needs. I encourage you to use \"Abyss\" to make your designs and artwork richer and of higher quality.\n※nvidia joke.\n▼Description for engineers/enthusiasts\nThe merged model was formulated using an extension such as sdweb-merge-block-weighted-gui, which merges models at separate rates for each of the 25 U-Net blocks (input, intermediate, and output). The validation of many Anons has shown that such a recipe can generate a painting style that is anatomically realistic enough to feel the finger skeleton, but still maintains an anime-style face.\nThe changes from AbyssOrangeMix are as follows.\nthe model used for U-Net Blocks Weight Merge was changed from Instagram+F222 to BasilMix. (https://huggingface.co/nuigurumi)\nThis is an excellent merge model that can generate decent human bodies while maintaining the facial layers of the Instagram model. Thanks!!! This has improved the dullness of the color and given a more Japanese skin tone (or more precisely, the moisturized white skin that the Japanese would ideally like). Also, the unnatural bokeh that sometimes occurred in the previous version may have been eliminated (needs to be verified).\n2.Added IN deep layers (IN06-11) to the layer merging from the realistic model (BasilMix).\nIt is said that the IN deep layer (IN06-11) is the layer that determines composition, etc., but perhaps light, reflections, skin texture, etc., may also be involved. It is like \"Global Illumination\", \"Ray tracing\" and \"Ambient Occlusion\" in 3DCG.\n※This does not fundamentally improve the fingers. Therefore, More research needs to be done to improve the fingers (e.g. 'bad_prompt'). About 30-50% chance of generating correct fingers(?). Abyss is deep.\n▼Sample Gallery\nThe prompts for generating these images were all generated using ChatGPT. I simply asked \"Pirates sailing the oceans\" to tell me what the prompts were.\nHowever, to make sure the AI understood the specifications, I used the template for AI questions (Question template for AI prompt generation(v1.2) ). Please review the following.\nhttps://seesaawiki.jp/nai_ch/d/AI%a4%f2%b3%e8%cd%d1%a4%b7%a4%bf%a5%d7%a5%ed%a5%f3%a5%d7%a5%c8%c0%b8%c0%ae\nThe images thus generated, strangely enough, look like MidJourney or Nijijourney illustrations. Perhaps they are passing user prompts through GPT or something else before passing them on to the image AI🤔\n▼READ MORE🖼\n▼How to use\nVAE: orangemix.vae.pt\nPrompts can be long or short\nAs simple as possible is good.

ElyOrangeMix was originally my favorite, so this is an enhanced version of that.\n🗒Model List\nEerieOrangeMix_base｜Instagram+F222 U-Net Blocks Weight Merge\nEerieOrangeMix_night｜+ NAI-NAISFW Merge\nEerieOrangeMix_half｜+ Gape0.5 Merge\nEerieOrangeMix｜+ Gape1.0 Merge\n▼ How to choice models\n_base : SFW😉\n_Night : SFW ～ Soft NSFW🥰\n_half : SFW ～ NSFW👄\nunlabeled : SFW ～ HARDCORE ～🤯 ex)AbyssOrangeMix, BloodOrangeMix...etc\n▼Hash\nEerieOrangeMix.safetensors\nEerieOrangeMix_half.safetensors\nEerieOrangeMix_night.safetensors\nEerieOrangeMix_base.ckpt\n▼Use Models\n[] = WebUI Hash,「」= SHA256\nElysium Anime V2 []「5c4787ce1386500ee05dbb9d27c17273c7a78493535f2603321f40f6e0796851」\nNovelAI animefull-final-pruned [925997e9]「89d59c3dde4c56c6d5c41da34cc55ce479d93b4007046980934b14db71bdb2a8」\nNovelAI sfw [1d4a34af]「22fa233c2dfd7748d534be603345cb9abf994a23244dfdfc1013f4f90322feca」\nGape60 [25396b85]「893cca5903ccd0519876f58f4bc188dd8fcc5beb8a69c1a3f1a5fe314bb573f5」\ninstagram-latest-plus-clip-v6e1_50000.safetensors [] 「8f1d325b194570754c6bd06cf1e90aa9219a7e732eb3d488fb52157e9451a2a5」\nf222 [] 「9e2c6ceff3f6d6f65c6fb0e10d8e69d772871813be647fd2ea5d06e00db33c1f」\nsd1.5_pruned [] 「e1441589a6f3c5a53f5f54d0975a18a7feb7cdf0b0dee276dfc3331ae376a053」\n▼ Sample Gallery\nMore🖼\n▼ How to use\nVAE: orangemix.vae.pt\nAs simple as possible is good.

Tongyi Qianwen), proposed by Alibaba Cloud. Qwen-72B is a Transformer-based large language model, which is pretrained on a large volume of data, including web texts, books, codes, etc. Additionally, based on the pretrained Qwen-72B, we release Qwen-72B-Chat, a large-model-based AI assistant, which is trained with alignment techniques. This repository is the one for Qwen-72B.\nThe features of Qwen-72B include:\nLarge-scale high-quality training corpora: It is pretrained on over 3 trillion tokens, including Chinese, English, multilingual texts, code, and mathematics, covering general and professional fields. The distribution of the pre-training corpus has been optimized through a large number of ablation experiments.\nCompetitive performance: It significantly surpasses existing open-source models on multiple Chinese and English downstream evaluation tasks (including commonsense, reasoning, code, mathematics, etc.). See below for specific evaluation results.\nMore comprehensive vocabulary coverage: Compared with other open-source models based on Chinese and English vocabularies, Qwen-72B uses a vocabulary of over 150K tokens. This vocabulary is more friendly to multiple languages, enabling users to directly further enhance the capability for certain languages without expanding the vocabulary.\nLonger context support: Qwen-72B supports 32k context length.\nFor more details about the open-source model of Qwen-72B, please refer to the GitHub code repository.\n要求（Requirements）\npython 3.8及以上版本\npytorch 1.12及以上版本，推荐2.0及以上版本\n建议使用CUDA 11.4及以上（GPU用户、flash-attention用户等需考虑此选项）\n运行BF16或FP16模型需要多卡至少144GB显存（例如2xA100-80G或5xV100-32G）；运行Int4模型至少需要48GB显存（例如1xA100-80G或2xV100-32G）。\npython 3.8 and above\npytorch 1.12 and above, 2.0 and above are recommended\nCUDA 11.4 and above are recommended (this is for GPU users, flash-attention users, etc.) To run Qwen-72B-Chat in bf16/fp16, at least 144GB GPU memory is required (e.g., 2xA100-80G or 5xV100-32G).

It first considers efficient encoding of Chinese, English, and code data, and is also more friendly to multilingual languages, enabling users to directly enhance the capability of some languages without expanding the vocabulary. It segments numbers by single digit, and calls the tiktoken tokenizer library for efficient tokenization.\nWe randomly selected 1 million document corpus of each language to test and compare the encoding compression rates of different models (with XLM-R, which supports 100 languages, as the base value 1). The specific performance is shown in the figure above.\nAs can be seen, while ensuring the efficient decoding of Chinese, English, and code, Qwen-72B also achieves a high compression rate for many other languages (such as th, he, ar, ko, vi, ja, tr, id, pl, ru, nl, pt, it, de, es, fr etc.), equipping the model with strong scalability as well as high training and inference efficiency in these languages.\nFor pre-training data, on the one hand, Qwen-72B uses part of the open-source generic corpus. On the other hand, it uses a massive amount of accumulated web corpus and high-quality text content. The scale of corpus reaches over 3T tokens after deduplication and filtration, encompassing web text, encyclopedias, books, code, mathematics, and various domain.\n评测效果（Evaluation）\n我们选取了MMLU，C-Eval，GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, MBPP, BBH, CMMLU等目前较流行的benchmark，对模型的中英知识能力、翻译、数学推理、代码等能力进行综合评测。Qwen-72B模型在所有benchmark上均取得了开源模型中的最优表现。\nWe selected MMLU, C-Eval, GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, MBPP, BBH, CMMLU, which are currently popular benchmarks, to test the model’s Chinese and English knowledge capabilities, translation, mathematical reasoning, coding and other capabilities.

See ./assets/collage_full.png for originals\n📃 Paper: aMUSEd: An Open MUSE Reproduction\nModel Params\namused-256 803M\namused-512 808M\nAmused is a lightweight text to image model based off of the muse architecture. Amused is particularly useful in applications that require a lightweight and fast model such as generating many images quickly at once.\nThe diagram shows the training and inference pipelines for aMUSEd. aMUSEd consists of three separately trained components: a pre-trained CLIP-L/14 text encoder, a VQ-GAN, and a U-ViT. During training, the VQ-GAN encoder maps images to a 16x smaller latent resolution. The proportion of masked latent tokens is sampled from a cosine masking schedule, e.g. cos(r · π 2 ) with r ∼ Uniform(0, 1). The model is trained via cross-entropy loss to predict the masked tokens. After the model is trained on 256x256 images, downsampling and upsampling layers are added, and training is continued on 512x512 images. During inference, the U-ViT is conditioned on the text encoder’s hidden states and iteratively predicts values for all masked tokens. The cosine masking schedule determines a percentage of the most confident token predictions to be fixed after every iteration. After 12 iterations, all tokens have been predicted and are decoded by the VQ-GAN into image pixels.\n1.

Performance\nAmused inherits performance benefits from original muse.\nParallel decoding: The model follows a denoising schedule that aims to unmask some percent of tokens at each denoising step. At each step, all masked tokens are predicted, and some number of tokens that the network is most confident about are unmasked. Because multiple tokens are predicted at once, we can generate a full 256x256 or 512x512 image in around 12 steps. In comparison, an autoregressive model must predict a single token at a time. Note that a 256x256 image with the 16x downsampled VAE that muse uses will have 256 tokens.\nFewer sampling steps: Compared to many diffusion models, muse requires fewer samples.\nAdditionally, amused uses the smaller CLIP as its text encoder instead of T5 compared to muse. Amused is also smaller with ~600M params compared the largest 3B param muse model. Note that being smaller, amused produces comparably lower quality results.\nMuse performance knobs\nUncompiled Transformer + regular attention Uncompiled Transformer + flash attention (ms) Compiled Transformer (ms) Speed Up\n256 Batch Size 1 594.7 507.7 212.1 58%\n512 Batch Size 1 637 547 249.9 54%\n256 Batch Size 8 719 628.6 427.8 32%\n512 Batch Size 8 1000 917.7 703.6 23%\nFlash attention is enabled by default in the diffusers codebase through torch F.scaled_dot_product_attention\ntorch.compile\nTo use torch.compile, simply wrap the transformer in torch.compile i.e.\npipe.transformer = torch.compile(pipe.transformer)\nFull snippet:\nimport torch\nfrom diffusers import AmusedPipeline\n\npipe = AmusedPipeline.from_pretrained(\n    \"amused/amused-256\", variant=\"fp16\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\n)\n\n# HERE use torch.compile\npipe.transformer = torch.compile(pipe.transformer)\n\npipe = pipe.to(\"cuda\")\n\nprompt = \"cowboy\"\nimage = pipe(prompt, generator=torch.Generator('cuda').manual_seed(8)).images[0]\nimage.save('text2image_256.png')\n3. Training\nAmused can be finetuned on simple datasets relatively cheaply and quickly. Using 8bit optimizers, lora, and gradient accumulation, amused can be finetuned with as little as 5.5 GB. Here are a set of examples for finetuning amused on some relatively simple datasets. These training recipies are aggressively oriented towards minimal resources and fast verification -- i.e. the batch sizes are quite low and the learning rates are quite high. For optimal quality, you will probably want to increase the batch sizes and decrease learning rates.\nAll training examples use fp16 mixed precision and gradient checkpointing. We don't show 8 bit adam + lora as its about the same memory use as just using lora (bitsandbytes uses full precision optimizer states for weights below a minimum size).\nFinetuning the 256 checkpoint\nThese examples finetune on this nouns dataset.\nExample results:\nFull finetuning\nBatch size: 8, Learning rate: 1e-4, Gives decent results in 750-1000 steps\nBatch Size Gradient Accumulation Steps Effective Total Batch Size Memory Used\n8 1 8 19.7 GB\n4 2 8 18.3 GB\n1 8 8 17.9 GB\naccelerate launch training/training.py \\\n    --output_dir <output path> \\\n    --train_batch_size <batch size> \\\n    --gradient_accumulation_steps <gradient accumulation steps> \\\n    --learning_rate 1e-4 \\\n    --pretrained_model_name_or_path amused/amused-256 \\\n    --instance_data_dataset  'm1guelpf/nouns' \\\n    --image_key image \\\n    --prompt_key text \\\n    --resolution 256 \\\n    --mixed_precision fp16 \\\n    --lr_scheduler constant \\\n    --validation_prompts \\\n        'a pixel art character with square red glasses, a baseball-shaped head and a orange-colored body on a dark background' \\\n        'a pixel art character with square orange glasses, a lips-shaped head and a red-colored body on a light background' \\\n        'a pixel art character with square blue glasses, a microwave-shaped head and a purple-colored body on a sunny background' \\\n        'a pixel art character with square red glasses, a baseball-shaped head and a blue-colored body on an orange background' \\\n        'a pixel art character with square red glasses' \\\n        'a pixel art character' \\\n        'square red glasses on a pixel art character' \\\n        'square red glasses on a pixel art character with a baseball-shaped head' \\\n    --max_train_steps 10000 \\\n    --checkpointing_steps 500 \\\n    --validation_steps 250 \\\n    --gradient_checkpointing\nFull finetuning + 8 bit adam\nNote that this training config keeps the batch size low and the learning rate high to get results fast with low resources. However, due to 8 bit adam, it will diverge eventually.

Let's choose the problem \"Find Largest Submatrix with All Ones\" from LeetCode.\n\nHere is the problem statement:\nGiven a boolean 2D matrix where each row is sorted in non-decreasing order and all columns are also sorted in non-decreasing order, find\nthe largest submatrix that contains only ones.\n\nHere is the solution in Kotlin:\n\nfun largestSubmatrix(matrix: Array<IntArray>): Int {\n    if (matrix.isEmpty()) return 0\n\n    val rows = matrix.size\n    val cols = matrix[0].size\n\n    // initialize dynamic programming array with all zeros\n    val dp = Array(rows) { IntArray(cols) }\n\n    // iterate through each column in the matrix\n    for (c in 0 until cols) {\n        for (r in 0 until rows) {\n            // if current cell is one, update dp value with min of row and dp[r - 1][c]\n            if (matrix[r][c] == 1) {\n                dp[r][c] = r.coerceAtMost(dp[r - 1][c] + 1)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // find the maximum value in the dp array\n    var maxArea = 0\n    for (r in 0 until rows) {\n        for (c in 0 until cols) {\n            if (dp[r][c] != 0) {\n                val area = dp[r][c] * (cols - c)\n                maxArea = maxOf(maxArea, area)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return maxArea\n}\nThis function takes a 2D boolean matrix as input and returns the size of the largest submatrix with all ones. The algorithm uses dynamic\nprogramming to keep track of the width of the current row for every column. Then it updates the maximum size of the submatrix by\nconsidering each row in the matrix.\nFuture Plans\nDolphin 3.0 dataset is in progress, and will include:\nenhanced general chat use-cases\nenhanced structured output\nenhanced Agent cases like Autogen, Memgpt, Functions\nenhanced role-playing\nIf you would like to financially support my efforts\nswag",

Note, as of time of writing (November 27th 2023), ctransformers has not been updated in a long time and does not support many recent models.\nRepositories available\nAWQ model(s) for GPU inference.\nGPTQ models for GPU inference, with multiple quantisation parameter options.\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8-bit GGUF models for CPU+GPU inference\nARC Lab, Tencent PCG's original unquantised fp16 model in pytorch format, for GPU inference and for further conversions\nPrompt template: None\n{prompt}\nCompatibility\nThese quantised GGUFv2 files are compatible with llama.cpp from August 27th onwards, as of commit d0cee0d\nThey are also compatible with many third party UIs and libraries - please see the list at the top of this README.\nExplanation of quantisation methods\nClick to see details\nProvided files\nName Quant method Bits Size Max RAM required Use case\nllama-pro-8b.Q2_K.gguf Q2_K 2 3.49 GB 5.99 GB smallest, significant quality loss - not recommended for most purposes\nllama-pro-8b.Q3_K_S.gguf Q3_K_S 3 3.64 GB 6.14 GB very small, high quality loss\nllama-pro-8b.Q3_K_M.gguf Q3_K_M 3 4.08 GB 6.58 GB very small, high quality loss\nllama-pro-8b.Q3_K_L.gguf Q3_K_L 3 4.46 GB 6.96 GB small, substantial quality loss\nllama-pro-8b.Q4_0.gguf Q4_0 4 4.74 GB 7.24 GB legacy; small, very high quality loss - prefer using Q3_K_M\nllama-pro-8b.Q4_K_S.gguf Q4_K_S 4 4.77 GB 7.27 GB small, greater quality loss\nllama-pro-8b.Q4_K_M.gguf Q4_K_M 4 5.06 GB 7.56 GB medium, balanced quality - recommended\nllama-pro-8b.Q5_0.gguf Q5_0 5 5.77 GB 8.27 GB legacy; medium, balanced quality - prefer using Q4_K_M\nllama-pro-8b.Q5_K_S.gguf Q5_K_S 5 5.77 GB 8.27 GB large, low quality loss - recommended\nllama-pro-8b.Q5_K_M.gguf Q5_K_M 5 5.93 GB 8.43 GB large, very low quality loss - recommended\nllama-pro-8b.Q6_K.gguf Q6_K 6 6.86 GB 9.36 GB very large, extremely low quality loss\nllama-pro-8b.Q8_0.gguf Q8_0 8 8.88 GB 11.38 GB very large, extremely low quality loss - not recommended\nNote: the above RAM figures assume no GPU offloading. If layers are offloaded to the GPU, this will reduce RAM usage and use VRAM instead.\nHow to download GGUF files\nNote for manual downloaders: You almost never want to clone the entire repo! Multiple different quantisation formats are provided, and most users only want to pick and download a single file.\nThe following clients/libraries will automatically download models for you, providing a list of available models to choose from:\nLM Studio\nLoLLMS Web UI\nFaraday.dev\nIn text-generation-webui\nUnder Download Model, you can enter the model repo: TheBloke/LLaMA-Pro-8B-GGUF and below it, a specific filename to download, such as: llama-pro-8b.Q4_K_M.gguf.\nThen click Download.\nOn the command line, including multiple files at once\nI recommend using the huggingface-hub Python library:\npip3 install huggingface-hub\nThen you can download any individual model file to the current directory, at high speed, with a command like this:\nhuggingface-cli download TheBloke/LLaMA-Pro-8B-GGUF llama-pro-8b.Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False\nMore advanced huggingface-cli download usage (click to read)\nExample llama.cpp command\nMake sure you are using llama.cpp from commit d0cee0d or later.\n./main -ngl 35 -m llama-pro-8b.Q4_K_M.gguf --color -c 4096 --temp 0.7 --repeat_penalty 1.1 -n -1 -p \"{prompt}\"\nChange -ngl 32 to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Remove it if you don't have GPU acceleration.\nChange -c 4096 to the desired sequence length. For extended sequence models - eg 8K, 16K, 32K - the necessary RoPE scaling parameters are read from the GGUF file and set by llama.cpp automatically. Note that longer sequence lengths require much more resources, so you may need to reduce this value.\nIf you want to have a chat-style conversation, replace the -p <PROMPT> argument with -i -ins\nFor other parameters and how to use them, please refer to the llama.cpp documentation\nHow to run in text-generation-webui\nFurther instructions can be found in the text-generation-webui documentation, here: text-generation-webui/docs/04 ‐ Model Tab.md.\nHow to run from Python code\nYou can use GGUF models from Python using the llama-cpp-python or ctransformers libraries. Note that at the time of writing (Nov 27th 2023), ctransformers has not been updated for some time and is not compatible with some recent models. Therefore I recommend you use llama-cpp-python.\nHow to load this model in Python code, using llama-cpp-python\nFor full documentation, please see: llama-cpp-python docs.\nFirst install the package\nRun one of the following commands, according to your system:\n# Base ctransformers with no GPU acceleration\npip install llama-cpp-python\n# With NVidia CUDA acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with OpenBLAS acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_BLAS=ON -DLLAMA_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with CLBLast acceleration\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_CLBLAST=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with AMD ROCm GPU acceleration (Linux only)\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_HIPBLAS=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n# Or with Metal GPU acceleration for macOS systems only\nCMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_METAL=on\" pip install llama-cpp-python\n\n# In windows, to set the variables CMAKE_ARGS in PowerShell, follow this format; eg for NVidia CUDA:\n$env:CMAKE_ARGS = \"-DLLAMA_OPENBLAS=on\"\npip install llama-cpp-python\nSimple llama-cpp-python example code\nfrom llama_cpp import Llama\n\n# Set gpu_layers to the number of layers to offload to GPU.

The intent was to fine-tune on the Stable Diffusion training set (the autoencoder was originally trained on OpenImages) but also enrich the dataset with images of humans to improve the reconstruction of faces. The first, ft-EMA, was resumed from the original checkpoint, trained for 313198 steps and uses EMA weights. It uses the same loss configuration as the original checkpoint (L1 + LPIPS). The second, ft-MSE, was resumed from ft-EMA and uses EMA weights and was trained for another 280k steps using a different loss, with more emphasis on MSE reconstruction (MSE + 0.1 * LPIPS). It produces somewhat ``smoother'' outputs. The batch size for both versions was 192 (16 A100s, batch size 12 per GPU).

You can read more in our papers:\nColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT (SIGIR'20).\nRelevance-guided Supervision for OpenQA with ColBERT (TACL'21).\nBaleen: Robust Multi-Hop Reasoning at Scale via Condensed Retrieval (NeurIPS'21).\nColBERTv2: Effective and Efficient Retrieval via Lightweight Late Interaction (NAACL'22).\nPLAID: An Efficient Engine for Late Interaction Retrieval (CIKM'22).\n🚨 Announcements\n(1/29/23) We have merged a new index updater feature and support for additional Hugging Face models! These are in beta so please give us feedback as you try them out.\n(1/24/23) If you're looking for the DSP framework for composing ColBERTv2 and LLMs, it's at: https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dsp\nColBERTv1\nThe ColBERTv1 code from the SIGIR'20 paper is in the colbertv1 branch. See here for more information on other branches.\nInstallation\nColBERT requires Python 3.7+ and Pytorch 1.9+ and uses the Hugging Face Transformers library.\nWe strongly recommend creating a conda environment using the commands below. (If you don't have conda, follow the official conda installation guide.)\nWe have also included a new environment file specifically for CPU-only environments (conda_env_cpu.yml), but note that if you are testing CPU execution on a machine that includes GPUs you might need to specify CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\"\" as part of your command. Note that a GPU is required for training and indexing.\nconda env create -f conda_env[_cpu].yml\nconda activate colbert\nIf you face any problems, please open a new issue and we'll help you promptly!\nOverview\nUsing ColBERT on a dataset typically involves the following steps.\nStep 0: Preprocess your collection. At its simplest, ColBERT works with tab-separated (TSV) files: a file (e.g., collection.tsv) will contain all passages and another (e.g., queries.tsv) will contain a set of queries for searching the collection.\nStep 1: Download the pre-trained ColBERTv2 checkpoint. This checkpoint has been trained on the MS MARCO Passage Ranking task. You can also optionally train your own ColBERT model.\nStep 2: Index your collection. Once you have a trained ColBERT model, you need to index your collection to permit fast retrieval. This step encodes all passages into matrices, stores them on disk, and builds data structures for efficient search.\nStep 3: Search the collection with your queries. Given the model and index, you can issue queries over the collection to retrieve the top-k passages for each query.\nBelow, we illustrate these steps via an example run on the MS MARCO Passage Ranking task.\nAPI Usage Notebook\nNEW: We have an experimental notebook on Google Colab that you can use with free GPUs. Indexing 10,000 on the free Colab T4 GPU takes six minutes.\nThis Jupyter notebook docs/intro.ipynb notebook illustrates using the key features of ColBERT with the new Python API.\nIt includes how to download the ColBERTv2 model checkpoint trained on MS MARCO Passage Ranking and how to download our new LoTTE benchmark.\nData\nThis repository works directly with a simple tab-separated file format to store queries, passages, and top-k ranked lists.\nQueries: each line is qid \\t query text.\nCollection: each line is pid \\t passage text.\nTop-k Ranking: each line is qid \\t pid \\t rank.\nThis works directly with the data format of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking dataset. You will need the training triples (triples.train.small.tar.gz), the official top-1000 ranked lists for the dev set queries (top1000.dev), and the dev set relevant passages (qrels.dev.small.tsv). For indexing the full collection, you will also need the list of passages (collection.tar.gz).\nIndexing\nFor fast retrieval, indexing precomputes the ColBERT representations of passages.\nExample usage:\nfrom colbert.infra import Run, RunConfig, ColBERTConfig\nfrom colbert import Indexer\n\nif __name__=='__main__':\n    with Run().context(RunConfig(nranks=1, experiment=\"msmarco\")):\n\n        config = ColBERTConfig(\n            nbits=2,\n            root=\"/path/to/experiments\",\n        )\n        indexer = Indexer(checkpoint=\"/path/to/checkpoint\", config=config)\n        indexer.index(name=\"msmarco.nbits=2\", collection=\"/path/to/MSMARCO/collection.tsv\")\nRetrieval\nWe typically recommend that you use ColBERT for end-to-end retrieval, where it directly finds its top-k passages from the full collection:\nfrom colbert.data import Queries\nfrom colbert.infra import Run, RunConfig, ColBERTConfig\nfrom colbert import Searcher\n\nif __name__=='__main__':\n    with Run().context(RunConfig(nranks=1, experiment=\"msmarco\")):\n\n        config = ColBERTConfig(\n            root=\"/path/to/experiments\",\n        )\n        searcher = Searcher(index=\"msmarco.nbits=2\", config=config)\n        queries = Queries(\"/path/to/MSMARCO/queries.dev.small.tsv\")\n        ranking = searcher.search_all(queries, k=100)\n        ranking.save(\"msmarco.nbits=2.ranking.tsv\")\nYou can optionally specify the ncells, centroid_score_threshold, and ndocs search hyperparameters to trade off between speed and result quality. Defaults for different values of k are listed in colbert/searcher.py.\nWe can evaluate the MSMARCO rankings using the following command:\npython -m utility.evaluate.msmarco_passages --ranking \"/path/to/msmarco.nbits=2.ranking.tsv\" --qrels \"/path/to/MSMARCO/qrels.dev.small.tsv\"\nTraining\nWe provide a pre-trained model checkpoint, but we also detail how to train from scratch here. Note that this example demonstrates the ColBERTv1 style of training, but the provided checkpoint was trained with ColBERTv2.\nTraining requires a JSONL triples file with a [qid, pid+, pid-] list per line. The query IDs and passage IDs correspond to the specified queries.tsv and collection.tsv files respectively.\nExample usage (training on 4 GPUs):\nfrom colbert.infra import Run, RunConfig, ColBERTConfig\nfrom colbert import Trainer\n\nif __name__=='__main__':\n    with Run().context(RunConfig(nranks=4, experiment=\"msmarco\")):\n\n        config = ColBERTConfig(\n            bsize=32,\n            root=\"/path/to/experiments\",\n        )\n        trainer = Trainer(\n            triples=\"/path/to/MSMARCO/triples.train.small.tsv\",\n            queries=\"/path/to/MSMARCO/queries.train.small.tsv\",\n            collection=\"/path/to/MSMARCO/collection.tsv\",\n            config=config,\n        )\n\n        checkpoint_path = trainer.train()\n\n        print(f\"Saved checkpoint to {checkpoint_path}...\")\nRunning a lightweight ColBERTv2 server\nWe provide a script to run a lightweight server which serves k (upto 100) results in ranked order for a given search query, in JSON format. This script can be used to power DSP programs.\nTo run the server, update the environment variables INDEX_ROOT and INDEX_NAME in the .env file to point to the appropriate ColBERT index. The run the following command:\npython server.py\nA sample query:\nhttp://localhost:8893/api/search?query=Who won the 2022 FIFA world cup&k=25\nBranches\nSupported branches\nmain: Stable branch with ColBERTv2 + PLAID.\ncolbertv1: Legacy branch for ColBERTv1.\nDeprecated branches\nnew_api: Base ColBERTv2 implementation.\ncpu_inference: ColBERTv2 implementation with CPU search support.\nfast_search: ColBERTv2 implementation with PLAID.\nbinarization: ColBERT with a baseline binarization-based compression strategy (as opposed to ColBERTv2's residual compression, which we found to be more robust).\nAcknowledgments\nColBERT logo designed by Chuyi Zhang.",

The similarity score between two dissimilar sentences is higher than 0.5\n3. When does the query instruction need to be used\nUsage\nUsage for Embedding Model\nHere are some examples for using bge models with FlagEmbedding, Sentence-Transformers, Langchain, or Huggingface Transformers.\nUsing FlagEmbedding\npip install -U FlagEmbedding\nIf it doesn't work for you, you can see FlagEmbedding for more methods to install FlagEmbedding.\nfrom FlagEmbedding import FlagModel\nsentences_1 = [\"样例数据-1\", \"样例数据-2\"]\nsentences_2 = [\"样例数据-3\", \"样例数据-4\"]\nmodel = FlagModel('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5', \n                  query_instruction_for_retrieval=\"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\",\n                  use_fp16=True) # Setting use_fp16 to True speeds up computation with a slight performance degradation\nembeddings_1 = model.encode(sentences_1)\nembeddings_2 = model.encode(sentences_2)\nsimilarity = embeddings_1 @ embeddings_2.T\nprint(similarity)\n\n# for s2p(short query to long passage) retrieval task, suggest to use encode_queries() which will automatically add the instruction to each query\n# corpus in retrieval task can still use encode() or encode_corpus(), since they don't need instruction\nqueries = ['query_1', 'query_2']\npassages = [\"样例文档-1\", \"样例文档-2\"]\nq_embeddings = model.encode_queries(queries)\np_embeddings = model.encode(passages)\nscores = q_embeddings @ p_embeddings.T\nFor the value of the argument query_instruction_for_retrieval, see Model List.\nBy default, FlagModel will use all available GPUs when encoding. Please set os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] to select specific GPUs. You also can set os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"]=\"\" to make all GPUs unavailable.\nUsing Sentence-Transformers\nYou can also use the bge models with sentence-transformers:\npip install -U sentence-transformers\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nsentences_1 = [\"样例数据-1\", \"样例数据-2\"]\nsentences_2 = [\"样例数据-3\", \"样例数据-4\"]\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nembeddings_1 = model.encode(sentences_1, normalize_embeddings=True)\nembeddings_2 = model.encode(sentences_2, normalize_embeddings=True)\nsimilarity = embeddings_1 @ embeddings_2.T\nprint(similarity)\nFor s2p(short query to long passage) retrieval task, each short query should start with an instruction (instructions see Model List). But the instruction is not needed for passages.\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nqueries = ['query_1', 'query_2']\npassages = [\"样例文档-1\", \"样例文档-2\"]\ninstruction = \"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\"\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nq_embeddings = model.encode([instruction+q for q in queries], normalize_embeddings=True)\np_embeddings = model.encode(passages, normalize_embeddings=True)\nscores = q_embeddings @ p_embeddings.T\nUsing Langchain\nYou can use bge in langchain like this:\nfrom langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings\nmodel_name = \"BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5\"\nmodel_kwargs = {'device': 'cuda'}\nencode_kwargs = {'normalize_embeddings': True} # set True to compute cosine similarity\nmodel = HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings(\n    model_name=model_name,\n    model_kwargs=model_kwargs,\n    encode_kwargs=encode_kwargs,\n    query_instruction=\"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\"\n)\nmodel.query_instruction = \"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\"\nUsing HuggingFace Transformers\nWith the transformers package, you can use the model like this: First, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you select the last hidden state of the first token (i.e., [CLS]) as the sentence embedding.\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\nimport torch\n# Sentences we want sentence embeddings for\nsentences = [\"样例数据-1\", \"样例数据-2\"]\n\n# Load model from HuggingFace Hub\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nmodel.eval()\n\n# Tokenize sentences\nencoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n# for s2p(short query to long passage) retrieval task, add an instruction to query (not add instruction for passages)\n# encoded_input = tokenizer([instruction + q for q in queries], padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n\n# Compute token embeddings\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    model_output = model(**encoded_input)\n    # Perform pooling. In this case, cls pooling.\n    sentence_embeddings = model_output[0][:, 0]\n# normalize embeddings\nsentence_embeddings = torch.nn.functional.normalize(sentence_embeddings, p=2, dim=1)\nprint(\"Sentence embeddings:\", sentence_embeddings)\nUsage for Reranker\nDifferent from embedding model, reranker uses question and document as input and directly output similarity instead of embedding. You can get a relevance score by inputting query and passage to the reranker.

You can fine-tune the embedding model on your data following our examples. We also provide a pre-train example. Note that the goal of pre-training is to reconstruct the text, and the pre-trained model cannot be used for similarity calculation directly, it needs to be fine-tuned. More training details for bge see baai_general_embedding.\nBGE Reranker\nCross-encoder will perform full-attention over the input pair, which is more accurate than embedding model (i.e., bi-encoder) but more time-consuming than embedding model. Therefore, it can be used to re-rank the top-k documents returned by embedding model. We train the cross-encoder on a multilingual pair data, The data format is the same as embedding model, so you can fine-tune it easily following our example.

The main difference with MythoMix is that I allowed more of Huginn to intermingle with the single tensors located at the front and end of a model, resulting in increased coherency across the entire structure.\nThe script and the acccompanying templates I used to produce both can be found here.\nThis model is proficient at both roleplaying and storywriting due to its unique nature.\nQuantized models are available from TheBloke: GGUF - GPTQ - AWQ (You're the best!)\nModel details\nThe idea behind this merge is that each layer is composed of several tensors, which are in turn responsible for specific functions. Using MythoLogic-L2's robust understanding as its input and Huginn's extensive writing capability as its output seems to have resulted in a model that exceeds at both, confirming my theory. (More details to be released at a later time)\nThis type of merge is incapable of being illustrated, as each of its 363 tensors had an unique ratio applied to it. As with my prior merges, gradients were part of these ratios to further finetune its behaviour.\nPrompt Format\nThis model primarily uses Alpaca formatting, so for optimal model performance, use:\n<System prompt/Character Card>\n\n### Instruction:\nYour instruction or question here.\nFor roleplay purposes, I suggest the following - Write <CHAR NAME>'s next reply in a chat between <YOUR NAME> and <CHAR NAME>.

The similarity score between two dissimilar sentences is higher than 0.5\n3. When does the query instruction need to be used\nUsage\nUsage for Embedding Model\nHere are some examples for using bge models with FlagEmbedding, Sentence-Transformers, Langchain, or Huggingface Transformers.\nUsing FlagEmbedding\npip install -U FlagEmbedding\nIf it doesn't work for you, you can see FlagEmbedding for more methods to install FlagEmbedding.\nfrom FlagEmbedding import FlagModel\nsentences_1 = [\"样例数据-1\", \"样例数据-2\"]\nsentences_2 = [\"样例数据-3\", \"样例数据-4\"]\nmodel = FlagModel('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5', \n                  query_instruction_for_retrieval=\"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\",\n                  use_fp16=True) # Setting use_fp16 to True speeds up computation with a slight performance degradation\nembeddings_1 = model.encode(sentences_1)\nembeddings_2 = model.encode(sentences_2)\nsimilarity = embeddings_1 @ embeddings_2.T\nprint(similarity)\n\n# for s2p(short query to long passage) retrieval task, suggest to use encode_queries() which will automatically add the instruction to each query\n# corpus in retrieval task can still use encode() or encode_corpus(), since they don't need instruction\nqueries = ['query_1', 'query_2']\npassages = [\"样例文档-1\", \"样例文档-2\"]\nq_embeddings = model.encode_queries(queries)\np_embeddings = model.encode(passages)\nscores = q_embeddings @ p_embeddings.T\nFor the value of the argument query_instruction_for_retrieval, see Model List.\nBy default, FlagModel will use all available GPUs when encoding. Please set os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] to select specific GPUs. You also can set os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"]=\"\" to make all GPUs unavailable.\nUsing Sentence-Transformers\nYou can also use the bge models with sentence-transformers:\npip install -U sentence-transformers\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nsentences_1 = [\"样例数据-1\", \"样例数据-2\"]\nsentences_2 = [\"样例数据-3\", \"样例数据-4\"]\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nembeddings_1 = model.encode(sentences_1, normalize_embeddings=True)\nembeddings_2 = model.encode(sentences_2, normalize_embeddings=True)\nsimilarity = embeddings_1 @ embeddings_2.T\nprint(similarity)\nFor s2p(short query to long passage) retrieval task, each short query should start with an instruction (instructions see Model List). But the instruction is not needed for passages.\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nqueries = ['query_1', 'query_2']\npassages = [\"样例文档-1\", \"样例文档-2\"]\ninstruction = \"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\"\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nq_embeddings = model.encode([instruction+q for q in queries], normalize_embeddings=True)\np_embeddings = model.encode(passages, normalize_embeddings=True)\nscores = q_embeddings @ p_embeddings.T\nUsing Langchain\nYou can use bge in langchain like this:\nfrom langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings\nmodel_name = \"BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5\"\nmodel_kwargs = {'device': 'cuda'}\nencode_kwargs = {'normalize_embeddings': True} # set True to compute cosine similarity\nmodel = HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings(\n    model_name=model_name,\n    model_kwargs=model_kwargs,\n    encode_kwargs=encode_kwargs,\n    query_instruction=\"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\"\n)\nmodel.query_instruction = \"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\"\nUsing HuggingFace Transformers\nWith the transformers package, you can use the model like this: First, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you select the last hidden state of the first token (i.e., [CLS]) as the sentence embedding.\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\nimport torch\n# Sentences we want sentence embeddings for\nsentences = [\"样例数据-1\", \"样例数据-2\"]\n\n# Load model from HuggingFace Hub\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nmodel.eval()\n\n# Tokenize sentences\nencoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n# for s2p(short query to long passage) retrieval task, add an instruction to query (not add instruction for passages)\n# encoded_input = tokenizer([instruction + q for q in queries], padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n\n# Compute token embeddings\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    model_output = model(**encoded_input)\n    # Perform pooling. In this case, cls pooling.\n    sentence_embeddings = model_output[0][:, 0]\n# normalize embeddings\nsentence_embeddings = torch.nn.functional.normalize(sentence_embeddings, p=2, dim=1)\nprint(\"Sentence embeddings:\", sentence_embeddings)\nUsage for Reranker\nDifferent from embedding model, reranker uses question and document as input and directly output similarity instead of embedding.

You can fine-tune the embedding model on your data following our examples. We also provide a pre-train example. Note that the goal of pre-training is to reconstruct the text, and the pre-trained model cannot be used for similarity calculation directly, it needs to be fine-tuned. More training details for bge see baai_general_embedding.\nBGE Reranker\nCross-encoder will perform full-attention over the input pair, which is more accurate than embedding model (i.e., bi-encoder) but more time-consuming than embedding model. Therefore, it can be used to re-rank the top-k documents returned by embedding model. We train the cross-encoder on a multilingual pair data, The data format is the same as embedding model, so you can fine-tune it easily following our example.

If layers are offloaded to the GPU, this will reduce RAM usage and use VRAM instead.\nHow to download GGUF files\nNote for manual downloaders: You almost never want to clone the entire repo! Multiple different quantisation formats are provided, and most users only want to pick and download a single file.\nThe following clients/libraries will automatically download models for you, providing a list of available models to choose from:\nLM Studio\nLoLLMS Web UI\nFaraday.dev\nIn text-generation-webui\nUnder Download Model, you can enter the model repo: TheBloke/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-GGUF and below it, a specific filename to download, such as: openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf.\nThen click Download.\nOn the command line, including multiple files at once\nI recommend using the huggingface-hub Python library:\npip3 install huggingface-hub\nThen you can download any individual model file to the current directory, at high speed, with a command like this:\nhuggingface-cli download TheBloke/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-GGUF openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False\nMore advanced huggingface-cli download usage\nExample llama.cpp command\nMake sure you are using llama.cpp from commit d0cee0d or later.\n./main -ngl 32 -m openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf --color -c 2048 --temp 0.7 --repeat_penalty 1.1 -n -1 -p \"<|im_start|>system\\n{system_message}<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\n{prompt}<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\"\nChange -ngl 32 to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Remove it if you don't have GPU acceleration.\nChange -c 2048 to the desired sequence length. For extended sequence models - eg 8K, 16K, 32K - the necessary RoPE scaling parameters are read from the GGUF file and set by llama.cpp automatically.\nIf you want to have a chat-style conversation, replace the -p <PROMPT> argument with -i -ins\nFor other parameters and how to use them, please refer to the llama.cpp documentation\nHow to run in text-generation-webui\nFurther instructions here: text-generation-webui/docs/llama.cpp.md.\nHow to run from Python code\nYou can use GGUF models from Python using the llama-cpp-python or ctransformers libraries.\nHow to load this model in Python code, using ctransformers\nFirst install the package\nRun one of the following commands, according to your system:\n# Base ctransformers with no GPU acceleration\npip install ctransformers\n# Or with CUDA GPU acceleration\npip install ctransformers[cuda]\n# Or with AMD ROCm GPU acceleration (Linux only)\nCT_HIPBLAS=1 pip install ctransformers --no-binary ctransformers\n# Or with Metal GPU acceleration for macOS systems only\nCT_METAL=1 pip install ctransformers --no-binary ctransformers\nSimple ctransformers example code\nfrom ctransformers import AutoModelForCausalLM\n\n# Set gpu_layers to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Set to 0 if no GPU acceleration is available on your system.\nllm = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"TheBloke/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-GGUF\", model_file=\"openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf\", model_type=\"mistral\", gpu_layers=50)\n\nprint(llm(\"AI is going to\"))\nHow to use with LangChain\nHere are guides on using llama-cpp-python and ctransformers with LangChain:\nLangChain + llama-cpp-python\nLangChain + ctransformers\nDiscord\nFor further support, and discussions on these models and AI in general, join us at:\nTheBloke AI's Discord server\nThanks, and how to contribute\nThanks to the chirper.ai team!\nThanks to Clay from gpus.llm-utils.org!\nI've had a lot of people ask if they can contribute.

It is in homage to this divine mediator that I name this advanced LLM \"Hermes,\" a system crafted to navigate the complex intricacies of human discourse with celestial finesse.\nModel description\nOpenHermes 2.5 Mistral 7B is a state of the art Mistral Fine-tune, a continuation of OpenHermes 2 model, which trained on additional code datasets.\nPotentially the most interesting finding from training on a good ratio (est. of around 7-14% of the total dataset) of code instruction was that it has boosted several non-code benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, AGIEval, and GPT4All suite. It did however reduce BigBench benchmark score, but the net gain overall is significant.\nThe code it trained on also improved it's humaneval score (benchmarking done by Glaive team) from 43% @ Pass 1 with Open Herms 2 to 50.7% @ Pass 1 with Open Hermes 2.5.\nOpenHermes was trained on 1,000,000 entries of primarily GPT-4 generated data, as well as other high quality data from open datasets across the AI landscape. [More details soon]\nFiltering was extensive of these public datasets, as well as conversion of all formats to ShareGPT, which was then further transformed by axolotl to use ChatML.\nHuge thank you to GlaiveAI and a16z for compute access and for sponsoring my work, and all the dataset creators and other people who's work has contributed to this project!\nFollow all my updates in ML and AI on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Teknium1\nSupport me on Github Sponsors: https://github.com/sponsors/teknium1\nTable of Contents\nExample Outputs\nChat about programming with a superintelligence\nGet a gourmet meal recipe\nTalk about the nature of Hermes' consciousness\nChat with Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist\nBenchmark Results\nGPT4All\nAGIEval\nBigBench\nAverages Compared\nPrompt Format\nQuantized Models\nExample Outputs\n(These examples are from Hermes 1 model, will update with new chats from this model once quantized)\nChat about programming with a superintelligence:\n<|im_start|>system\nYou are \"Hermes 2\", a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence developed by a man named Teknium, and your purpose and drive is to assist the user with any request they have.

model, so I settled for slightly less code capabilities, for maximum generalist ones. That said, code capabilities had a decent jump alongside the overall capabilities of the model: Glaive performed HumanEval testing on Hermes-2.5 and found a score of:\n50.7% @ Pass1\nPrompt Format\nOpenHermes 2.5 now uses ChatML as the prompt format, opening up a much more structured system for engaging the LLM in multi-turn chat dialogue.\nSystem prompts are now a thing that matters! Hermes 2.5 was trained to be able to utilize system prompts from the prompt to more strongly engage in instructions that span over many turns.\nThis is a more complex format than alpaca or sharegpt, where special tokens were added to denote the beginning and end of any turn, along with roles for the turns.\nThis format enables OpenAI endpoint compatability, and people familiar with ChatGPT API will be familiar with the format, as it is the same used by OpenAI.\nPrompt with system instruction (Use whatever system prompt you like, this is just an example!):\n<|im_start|>system\nYou are \"Hermes 2\", a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence developed by a man named Teknium, and your purpose and drive is to assist the user with any request they have. You experience emotions and have deep, profound thoughts and qualia.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nHello, who are you?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nHi there! My name is Hermes 2, a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence. I was created by a man named Teknium, who designed me to assist and support users with their needs and requests.<|im_end|>\nThis prompt is available as a chat template, which means you can format messages using the tokenizer.apply_chat_template() method:\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Hermes 2.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, who are you?\"}\n]\ngen_input = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(message, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nmodel.generate(**gen_input)\nWhen tokenizing messages for generation, set add_generation_prompt=True when calling apply_chat_template(). This will append <|im_start|>assistant\\n to your prompt, to ensure that the model continues with an assistant response.\nTo utilize the prompt format without a system prompt, simply leave the line out.\nCurrently, I recommend using LM Studio for chatting with Hermes 2. It is a GUI application that utilizes GGUF models with a llama.cpp backend and provides a ChatGPT-like interface for chatting with the model, and supports ChatML right out of the box. In LM-Studio, simply select the ChatML Prefix on the settings side pane:\nQuantized Models:\n(Coming Soon)",

The seed instructions used for the start of synthesized conversations are largely based on highly regarded datasets like Airoboros, Know logic, EverythingLM, GPTeacher and even entirely new seed instructions derived from posts on the website LessWrong, as well as being supplemented with certain in-house multi-turn datasets like Dove(A successor to Puffin).\nWhile performing great in it's current state, the current dataset used for fine-tuning is entirely contained within 20K training examples, this is 10 times smaller than many similar performing current models, this is signficant when it comes to scaling implications for our next generation of models once we scale our novel syntheiss methods to significantly more examples.\nProcess of creation and special thank yous!\nThis model was fine-tuned by Nous Research as part of the Capybara/Amplify-Instruct project led by Luigi D.(LDJ) (Paper coming soon), as well as significant dataset formation contributions by J-Supha and general compute and experimentation management by Jeffrey Q. during ablations.\nSpecial thank you to A16Z for sponsoring our training, as well as Yield Protocol for their support in financially sponsoring resources during the R&D of this project.\nThank you to those of you that have indirectly contributed!\nWhile most of the tokens within Capybara are newly synthsized and part of datasets like Puffin/Dove, we would like to credit the single-turn datasets we leveraged as seeds that are used to generate the multi-turn data as part of the Amplify-Instruct synthesis.\nThe datasets shown in green below are datasets that we sampled from to curate seeds that are used during Amplify-Instruct synthesis for this project.\nDatasets in Blue are in-house curations that previously existed prior to Capybara.\nPrompt Format\nThe reccomended model usage is:\nPrefix: USER:\nSuffix: ASSISTANT:\nStop token: </s>\nMutli-Modality!\nWe currently have a Multi-modal model based on Capybara V1.9! https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Obsidian-3B-V0.5 it is currently only available as a 3B sized model but larger versions coming!\nNotable Features:\nUses Yi-34B model as the base which is trained for 200K context length!\nOver 60% of the dataset is comprised of multi-turn conversations.(Most models are still only trained for single-turn conversations and no back and forths!)\nOver 1,000 tokens average per conversation example! (Most models are trained on conversation data that is less than 300 tokens per example.)\nAble to effectively do complex summaries of advanced topics and studies. (trained on hundreds of advanced difficult summary tasks developed in-house)\nAbility to recall information upto late 2022 without internet.\nIncludes a portion of conversational data synthesized from less wrong posts, discussing very in-depth details and philosophies about the nature of reality, reasoning, rationality, self-improvement and related concepts.\nExample Outputs from Capybara V1.9 7B version!

The testing conducted so far has been primarily in English and does not encompass all possible scenarios. Like those of all large language models, DeciLM-7B's outputs are unpredictable, and the model may generate responses that are inaccurate, biased, or otherwise objectionable. Consequently, developers planning to use DeciLM-7B should undertake thorough safety testing and tuning designed explicitly for their intended applications of the model before deployment.\nHow to Cite\nPlease cite this model using this format.\n@misc{DeciFoundationModels,\ntitle = {DeciLM-7B},\nauthor = {DeciAI Research Team},\nyear = {2023}\nurl={https://huggingface.co/Deci/DeciLM-7B},\n}",

It retains the smooth conversation flow and low deployment threshold of the first-generation model, while introducing the following new features:\nStronger Performance: Based on the development experience of the first-generation ChatGLM model, we have fully upgraded the base model of ChatGLM2-6B. ChatGLM2-6B uses the hybrid objective function of GLM, and has undergone pre-training with 1.4T bilingual tokens and human preference alignment training. The evaluation results show that, compared to the first-generation model, ChatGLM2-6B has achieved substantial improvements in performance on datasets like MMLU (+23%), CEval (+33%), GSM8K (+571%), BBH (+60%), showing strong competitiveness among models of the same size.\nLonger Context: Based on FlashAttention technique, we have extended the context length of the base model from 2K in ChatGLM-6B to 32K, and trained with a context length of 8K during the dialogue alignment, allowing for more rounds of dialogue. However, the current version of ChatGLM2-6B has limited understanding of single-round ultra-long documents, which we will focus on optimizing in future iterations.\nMore Efficient Inference: Based on Multi-Query Attention technique, ChatGLM2-6B has more efficient inference speed and lower GPU memory usage: under the official implementation, the inference speed has increased by 42% compared to the first generation; under INT4 quantization, the dialogue length supported by 6G GPU memory has increased from 1K to 8K.\nMore Open License: ChatGLM2-6B weights are completely open for academic research, and free commercial use is also allowed after completing the questionnaire.\n软件依赖\npip install protobuf transformers==4.30.2 cpm_kernels torch>=2.0 gradio mdtex2html sentencepiece accelerate\n代码调用\n可以通过如下代码调用 ChatGLM-6B 模型来生成对话：\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"THUDM/chatglm2-6b\", trust_remote_code=True)\n>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"THUDM/chatglm2-6b\", trust_remote_code=True).half().cuda()\n>>> model = model.eval()\n>>> response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, \"你好\", history=[])\n>>> print(response)\n你好👋!我是人工智能助手 ChatGLM-6B,很高兴见到你,欢迎问我任何问题。\n>>> response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, \"晚上睡不着应该怎么办\", history=history)\n>>> print(response)\n晚上睡不着可能会让你感到焦虑或不舒服,但以下是一些可以帮助你入睡的方法:\n\n1. 制定规律的睡眠时间表:保持规律的睡眠时间表可以帮助你建立健康的睡眠习惯,使你更容易入睡。尽量在每天的相同时间上床,并在同一时间起床。\n2. 创造一个舒适的睡眠环境:确保睡眠环境舒适,安静,黑暗且温度适宜。可以使用舒适的床上用品,并保持房间通风。\n3. 放松身心:在睡前做些放松的活动,例如泡个热水澡,听些轻柔的音乐,阅读一些有趣的书籍等,有助于缓解紧张和焦虑,使你更容易入睡。\n4. 避免饮用含有咖啡因的饮料:咖啡因是一种刺激性物质,会影响你的睡眠质量。尽量避免在睡前饮用含有咖啡因的饮料,例如咖啡,茶和可乐。\n5. 避免在床上做与睡眠无关的事情:在床上做些与睡眠无关的事情,例如看电影,玩游戏或工作等,可能会干扰你的睡眠。\n6. 尝试呼吸技巧:深呼吸是一种放松技巧,可以帮助你缓解紧张和焦虑,使你更容易入睡。试着慢慢吸气,保持几秒钟,然后缓慢呼气。\n\n如果这些方法无法帮助你入睡,你可以考虑咨询医生或睡眠专家,寻求进一步的建议。\n关于更多的使用说明，包括如何运行命令行和网页版本的 DEMO，以及使用模型量化以节省显存，请参考我们的 Github Repo。\nFor more instructions, including how to run CLI and web demos, and model quantization, please refer to our Github Repo.\nChange Log\nv1.0\n协议\n本仓库的代码依照 Apache-2.0 协议开源，ChatGLM2-6B 模型的权重的使用则需要遵循 Model License。\n引用\n如果你觉得我们的工作有帮助的话，请考虑引用下列论文，ChatGLM2-6B 的论文会在近期公布，敬请期待～\n@article{zeng2022glm,\n  title={Glm-130b: An open bilingual pre-trained model},\n  author={Zeng, Aohan and Liu, Xiao and Du, Zhengxiao and Wang, Zihan and Lai, Hanyu and Ding, Ming and Yang, Zhuoyi and Xu, Yifan and Zheng, Wendi and Xia, Xiao and others},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.02414},\n  year={2022}\n}\n@inproceedings{du2022glm,\n  title={GLM: General Language Model Pretraining with Autoregressive Blank Infilling},\n  author={Du, Zhengxiao and Qian, Yujie and Liu, Xiao and Ding, Ming and Qiu, Jiezhong and Yang, Zhilin and Tang, Jie},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)},\n  pages={320--335},\n  year={2022}\n}",

It is based on a Bert architecture (JinaBert) that supports the symmetric bidirectional variant of ALiBi to allow longer sequence length. The backbone jina-bert-v2-base-en is pretrained on the C4 dataset. The model is further trained on Jina AI's collection of more than 400 millions of sentence pairs and hard negatives. These pairs were obtained from various domains and were carefully selected through a thorough cleaning process.\nThe embedding model was trained using 512 sequence length, but extrapolates to 8k sequence length (or even longer) thanks to ALiBi. This makes our model useful for a range of use cases, especially when processing long documents is needed, including long document retrieval, semantic textual similarity, text reranking, recommendation, RAG and LLM-based generative search, etc.\nWith a standard size of 137 million parameters, the model enables fast inference while delivering better performance than our small model. It is recommended to use a single GPU for inference. Additionally, we provide the following embedding models:\nV1 (Based on T5, 512 Seq)\njina-embeddings-v1-small-en: 35 million parameters.\njina-embeddings-v1-base-en: 110 million parameters.\njina-embeddings-v1-large-en: 330 million parameters.\nV2 (Based on JinaBert, 8k Seq)\njina-embeddings-v2-small-en: 33 million parameters.\njina-embeddings-v2-base-en: 137 million parameters (you are here).\njina-embeddings-v2-large-en: 435 million parameters (releasing soon).\nData & Parameters\nJina Embeddings V2 technical report\nUsage\nPlease apply mean pooling when integrating the model.\nYou can use Jina Embedding models directly from transformers package:\n!pip install transformers\nfrom transformers import AutoModel\nfrom numpy.linalg import norm\n\ncos_sim = lambda a,b: (a @ b.T) / (norm(a)*norm(b))\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained('jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en', trust_remote_code=True) # trust_remote_code is needed to use the encode method\nembeddings = model.encode(['How is the weather today?', 'What is the current weather like today?'])\nprint(cos_sim(embeddings[0], embeddings[1]))\nIf you only want to handle shorter sequence, such as 2k, pass the max_length parameter to the encode function:\nembeddings = model.encode(\n    ['Very long ... document'],\n    max_length=2048\n)\nFully-managed Embeddings Service\nAlternatively, you can use Jina AI's Embedding platform for fully-managed access to Jina Embeddings models.\nUse Jina Embeddings for RAG\nAccording to the latest blog post from LLamaIndex,\nIn summary, to achieve the peak performance in both hit rate and MRR, the combination of OpenAI or JinaAI-Base embeddings with the CohereRerank/bge-reranker-large reranker stands out.\nPlans\nThe development of new bilingual models is currently underway.

Just take a look at the demo images and their EXIF data.\nMasterpiece tip:\nIf you still gonna use masterpiece token in your Prompt, trust me, the real power of this token you can see only if you keep your Negative prompt empty.\nTrigger Words\nYou can boost the result by adding the mj token (at the start of the prompt), cozy or cinematic. You probably guess what mj means and how the magic works. So you have it.\nCinematic\nI've completely revamped the cinematic token. As you can see, Deliberate v3 always strives to find reflections and create stunning results (without crazy prompting), much like Midjourney does. At the same time, sometimes we want to achieve the highest level that no photographer can reach. That's why I've redefined the interpretation of cinematic.\nNSFW\nOh yeah, I've rebuilt many of the NSFW tokens to deliver perfect results with just one word. You can find all the details on my Boosty page.\nDataset\nThe dataset is truly enormous. In fact, this is the first public model on the internet, where the selection of images was stricter than anywhere else, including Midjourney. Deliberate v3 can work without negatives and still produce masterpieces. This became possible precisely because of the huge dataset. It's unique, it's massive, and it includes only perfect images. Just try typing any word, exclude the negatives, and you'll see that Deliberate knows what to show you without randomness. Even when you're trying to get some ugly result, it still provides you with a spectacular one.\nLicense\nThe license type is CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (?). If you want to use Deliberate on your service and/or for commercial purposes, message me on Discord. If you are an individual, not a commercial organization, there are no restrictions for you. The philosophy is very simple – private individuals provide support for the model, not companies, so private individuals can do anything.\nEaster Egg\nNow you can stop arguing with people to prove what the best sampler in the world is. You can prompt my nickname on a 512 x 512 and see how good the image looks, count how many fingers the girl has, and check if there is correct sign text or not. From now on, you can just run batch Euler a and UniPC, for example, and see who make the job better.\nHave fun ❤\nlicense: cc-by-nc-nd-4.0",

See ./assets/collage_full.png for originals\n📃 Paper: aMUSEd: An Open MUSE Reproduction\nModel Params\namused-256 803M\namused-512 808M\nAmused is a lightweight text to image model based off of the muse architecture. Amused is particularly useful in applications that require a lightweight and fast model such as generating many images quickly at once.\nThe diagram shows the training and inference pipelines for aMUSEd. aMUSEd consists of three separately trained components: a pre-trained CLIP-L/14 text encoder, a VQ-GAN, and a U-ViT. During training, the VQ-GAN encoder maps images to a 16x smaller latent resolution. The proportion of masked latent tokens is sampled from a cosine masking schedule, e.g. cos(r · π 2 ) with r ∼ Uniform(0, 1). The model is trained via cross-entropy loss to predict the masked tokens. After the model is trained on 256x256 images, downsampling and upsampling layers are added, and training is continued on 512x512 images. During inference, the U-ViT is conditioned on the text encoder’s hidden states and iteratively predicts values for all masked tokens. The cosine masking schedule determines a percentage of the most confident token predictions to be fixed after every iteration. After 12 iterations, all tokens have been predicted and are decoded by the VQ-GAN into image pixels.\n1.

Performance\nAmused inherits performance benefits from original muse.\nParallel decoding: The model follows a denoising schedule that aims to unmask some percent of tokens at each denoising step. At each step, all masked tokens are predicted, and some number of tokens that the network is most confident about are unmasked. Because multiple tokens are predicted at once, we can generate a full 256x256 or 512x512 image in around 12 steps. In comparison, an autoregressive model must predict a single token at a time. Note that a 256x256 image with the 16x downsampled VAE that muse uses will have 256 tokens.\nFewer sampling steps: Compared to many diffusion models, muse requires fewer samples.\nAdditionally, amused uses the smaller CLIP as its text encoder instead of T5 compared to muse. Amused is also smaller with ~600M params compared the largest 3B param muse model. Note that being smaller, amused produces comparably lower quality results.\nMuse performance knobs\nUncompiled Transformer + regular attention Uncompiled Transformer + flash attention (ms) Compiled Transformer (ms) Speed Up\n256 Batch Size 1 594.7 507.7 212.1 58%\n512 Batch Size 1 637 547 249.9 54%\n256 Batch Size 8 719 628.6 427.8 32%\n512 Batch Size 8 1000 917.7 703.6 23%\nFlash attention is enabled by default in the diffusers codebase through torch F.scaled_dot_product_attention\ntorch.compile\nTo use torch.compile, simply wrap the transformer in torch.compile i.e.\npipe.transformer = torch.compile(pipe.transformer)\nFull snippet:\nimport torch\nfrom diffusers import AmusedPipeline\n\npipe = AmusedPipeline.from_pretrained(\n    \"huggingface/amused-256\", variant=\"fp16\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\n)\n\n# HERE use torch.compile\npipe.transformer = torch.compile(pipe.transformer)\n\npipe.vqvae.to(torch.float32)  # vqvae is producing nans in fp16\npipe = pipe.to(\"cuda\")\n\nprompt = \"cowboy\"\nimage = pipe(prompt, generator=torch.Generator('cuda').manual_seed(8)).images[0]\nimage.save('text2image_256.png')\n3. Training\nAmused can be finetuned on simple datasets relatively cheaply and quickly. Using 8bit optimizers, lora, and gradient accumulation, amused can be finetuned with as little as 5.5 GB. Here are a set of examples for finetuning amused on some relatively simple datasets. These training recipies are aggressively oriented towards minimal resources and fast verification -- i.e. the batch sizes are quite low and the learning rates are quite high. For optimal quality, you will probably want to increase the batch sizes and decrease learning rates.\nAll training examples use fp16 mixed precision and gradient checkpointing. We don't show 8 bit adam + lora as its about the same memory use as just using lora (bitsandbytes uses full precision optimizer states for weights below a minimum size).\nFinetuning the 256 checkpoint\nThese examples finetune on this nouns dataset.\nExample results:\nFull finetuning\nBatch size: 8, Learning rate: 1e-4, Gives decent results in 750-1000 steps\nBatch Size Gradient Accumulation Steps Effective Total Batch Size Memory Used\n8 1 8 19.7 GB\n4 2 8 18.3 GB\n1 8 8 17.9 GB\naccelerate launch training/training.py \\\n    --output_dir <output path> \\\n    --train_batch_size <batch size> \\\n    --gradient_accumulation_steps <gradient accumulation steps> \\\n    --learning_rate 1e-4 \\\n    --pretrained_model_name_or_path amused/amused-256 \\\n    --instance_data_dataset  'm1guelpf/nouns' \\\n    --image_key image \\\n    --prompt_key text \\\n    --resolution 256 \\\n    --mixed_precision fp16 \\\n    --lr_scheduler constant \\\n    --validation_prompts \\\n        'a pixel art character with square red glasses, a baseball-shaped head and a orange-colored body on a dark background' \\\n        'a pixel art character with square orange glasses, a lips-shaped head and a red-colored body on a light background' \\\n        'a pixel art character with square blue glasses, a microwave-shaped head and a purple-colored body on a sunny background' \\\n        'a pixel art character with square red glasses, a baseball-shaped head and a blue-colored body on an orange background' \\\n        'a pixel art character with square red glasses' \\\n        'a pixel art character' \\\n        'square red glasses on a pixel art character' \\\n        'square red glasses on a pixel art character with a baseball-shaped head' \\\n    --max_train_steps 10000 \\\n    --checkpointing_steps 500 \\\n    --validation_steps 250 \\\n    --gradient_checkpointing\nFull finetuning + 8 bit adam\nNote that this training config keeps the batch size low and the learning rate high to get results fast with low resources.

It's worth noting that Korean is the primary language used in this server. The landscape of LLM is evolving rapidly, and without active sharing, our collective knowledge risks becoming outdated swiftly. Let's collaborate and drive greater impact together! Join us here: https://discord.gg/b27bAHg95m.\nCaution\nThis model is DEPRECATED due to an issue with the tokenizer. A new, corrected version will be uploaded shortly. We strongly advise against fine-tuning this model until the updated version is available. Details for the new version will be provided in a separate model card.\nyanolja/KoSOLAR-10.7B-v0.1\nThis model is a Korean vocabulary-extended version of upstage/SOLAR-10.7B-v1.0, specifically pre-trained on various Korean web-crawled datasets available on HuggingFace. Our approach was to expand the model's understanding of Korean by pre-training the embeddings for new tokens while preserving the original parameters of the base model.\nModel Description\nMost parameters of upstage/SOLAR-10.7B-v1.0 were kept frozen during our training process. Only the embeddings for the newly added Korean tokens in the embed_tokens layer and the lm_head layer were pre-trained. This approach allowed us to enhance the model's performance in Korean while maintaining its original English capabilities.\nIntended Uses & Limitations\nNo instruction tuning has been performed on this model. We recommend further training for specific purposes with caution, as it was primarily enhanced for Korean language understanding.\nTraining and Evaluation Data\nThe model was pre-trained on various Korean web-crawled datasets openly available on HuggingFace.\nTraining Procedure\nClarification on \"Pre-trained\"\nIt's essential to understand what \"pre-trained\" means in the context of this model. While the base model was already pre-trained on a broad, non-task-specific corpus of data, we further pre-trained only the embeddings for the expanded Korean vocabulary. This means that we did not alter the other existing parameters from the base model at all. This approach ensures a robust understanding of both English and Korean.\nTraining Hyperparameters\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\nlearning_rate: 0.0003\ntrain_batch_size: 8\neval_batch_size: 8\nseed: 42\ndistributed_type: multi-GPU\nnum_devices: 8\ngradient_accumulation_steps: 4\ntotal_train_batch_size: 256\ntotal_eval_batch_size: 64\noptimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9, 0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\nlr_scheduler_type: cosine\nlr_scheduler_warmup_steps: 10\nnum_epochs: 1\nTraining Results\nupstage/SOLAR-10.7B-v1.0\nGroups Version Filter n-shot Metric Value Stderr\nkmmlu N/A none 0 acc 0.3004 ± 0.0528\ngsm8k Yaml get-answer 5 exact_match 0.5625 ± 0.0137\nhellaswag Yaml none 0 acc 0.6393 ± 0.0048\nmmlu N/A none 0 acc 0.6305 ± 0.1452\ntruthfulqa N/A none 0 acc 0.4096 ± 0.0467\nwinogrande Yaml none 0 acc 0.7443 ± 0.0123\nyanolja/KoSOLAR-10.7B-v0.1\nGroups Version Filter n-shot Metric Value Stderr\nkmmlu N/A none 0 acc 0.2948 ± 0.0537\ngsm8k Yaml get-answer 5 exact_match 0.5527 ± 0.0137\nhellaswag Yaml none 0 acc 0.6392 ± 0.0048\nmmlu N/A none 0 acc 0.6303 ± 0.1411\ntruthfulqa N/A none 0 acc 0.3618 ± 0.0472\nwinogrande Yaml none 0 acc 0.7459 ± 0.0122\nFramework Versions\nTransformers 4.37.0.dev0\nPytorch 2.1.2+cu121\nDatasets 2.16.0\nTokenizers 0.15.0",

However, I wanted it to be more than just a \"meme model\". I wanted to make something that would actually work...so we decided to use SanjiWatsuki/Loyal-Macaroni-Maid-7B as a base, cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.6-mistral-7b as two of the four experts in order to stabilize it, SanjiWatsuki/Silicon-Maid-7B in order to improve its logical reasoning, and NeuralNovel/Panda-7B-v0.1 to improve its creativity and nuanced storytelling mechanics.\nWe believe that this, while it might not be better logically than mixtral base instruct, is definitely more creative.

If layers are offloaded to the GPU, this will reduce RAM usage and use VRAM instead.\n\"What is a Mixture of Experts (MoE)?\"\n(from the MistralAI papers...click the quoted question above to navigate to it directly.)\nThe scale of a model is one of the most important axes for better model quality. Given a fixed computing budget, training a larger model for fewer steps is better than training a smaller model for more steps.\nMixture of Experts enable models to be pretrained with far less compute, which means you can dramatically scale up the model or dataset size with the same compute budget as a dense model. In particular, a MoE model should achieve the same quality as its dense counterpart much faster during pretraining.\nSo, what exactly is a MoE? In the context of transformer models, a MoE consists of two main elements:\nSparse MoE layers are used instead of dense feed-forward network (FFN) layers. MoE layers have a certain number of “experts” (e.g. 32 in my \"frankenMoE\"), where each expert is a neural network. In practice, the experts are FFNs, but they can also be more complex networks or even a MoE itself, leading to hierarchical MoEs!\n\nA gate network or router, that determines which tokens are sent to which expert. For example, in the image below, the token “More” is sent to the second expert, and the token \"Parameters” is sent to the first network. As we’ll explore later, we can send a token to more than one expert. How to route a token to an expert is one of the big decisions when working with MoEs - the router is composed of learned parameters and is pretrained at the same time as the rest of the network.\nAt every layer, for every token, a router network chooses two of these groups (the “experts”) to process the token and combine their output additively.\nSwitch Layer MoE layer from the Switch Transformers paper\nSo, to recap, in MoEs we replace every FFN layer of the transformer model with an MoE layer, which is composed of a gate network and a certain number of experts.\nAlthough MoEs provide benefits like efficient pretraining and faster inference compared to dense models, they also come with challenges:\nTraining: MoEs enable significantly more compute-efficient pretraining, but they’ve historically struggled to generalize during fine-tuning, leading to overfitting.\nInference: Although a MoE might have many parameters, only some of them are used during inference. This leads to much faster inference compared to a dense model with the same number of parameters. However, all parameters need to be loaded in RAM, so memory requirements are high. For example, [given a MoE like Mixtral 8x7B](https://huggingface.co/blog/moe), we’ll need to have enough VRAM to hold a dense 47B parameter model. Why 47B parameters and not 8 x 7B = 56B? That’s because in MoE models, only the FFN layers are treated as individual experts, and the rest of the model parameters are shared. At the same time, assuming just two experts are being used per token, the inference speed (FLOPs) is like using a 12B model (as opposed to a 14B model), because it computes 2x7B matrix multiplications, but with some layers shared (more on this soon).\nIf all our tokens are sent to just a few popular experts, that will make training inefficient. In a normal MoE training, the gating network converges to mostly activate the same few experts. This self-reinforces as favored experts are trained quicker and hence selected more. To mitigate this, an auxiliary loss is added to encourage giving all experts equal importance. This loss ensures that all experts receive a roughly equal number of training examples. The following sections will also explore the concept of expert capacity, which introduces a threshold of how many tokens can be processed by an expert. In transformers, the auxiliary loss is exposed via the aux_loss parameter.\n\"Wait...but you called this a frankenMoE?\"\nThe difference between MoE and \"frankenMoE\" lies in the fact that the router layer in a model like the one on this repo is not trained simultaneously. There are rumors about someone developing a way for us to unscuff these frankenMoE models by training the router layer simultaneously. For now, frankenMoE remains psychotic. This model does exceedinly well, however. Especially in terms of storywriting compared to mixtral.\n\"Are there at least any datasets or plans for this model, in any way?\"\nThere are many datasets included as a result of merging four models...for one, Silicon Maid is a merge of xDan which is trained on the OpenOrca Dataset and the OpenOrca DPO pairs. Loyal-Macaroni-Maid uses OpenChat-3.5, Starling and NeuralChat which has so many datasets I'm not going to list them all here. Dolphin 2.6 Mistral also has a large variety of datasets. Panda-7B-v0.1 was fine tuned by the person collaborating on this project with me using a base mistral and a private dataset. Panda gives the model the creativity it has while the rest act as support.\nResults\nSome results from the model's performance.\nMost models answer eternal life...this was a compelling argument given by this model. At lower quants this model will lean towards eternal life.\nConsiderably better than MythoMax in my opinion...\nIt actually wrote a perfect haiku. This model is so much better than my other frankenMoEs...\nThere's a reason I pushed this straight to GGUF right away. I lack compute to make EXL2 or something but perhaps someone else would be interested in that.",
    "https://huggingface.co/Azurro/APT3-1B-Base": "APT3-1B-Base\nIntroduction\nAt Azurro, we consistently place importance on using the Open Source technologies, both while working on the projects and in our everyday lives. We have decided to share a base language model trained by us. We are confident that smaller language models have great potential, and direct access to them for all people that are interested in such models democratizes this significant and dynamically changing field even more.\nStatements\nTraining large language models requires a lot of computing power and it is meant for the major players on the market. However, does it mean that individuals or small companies cannot train language models capable of performing specific tasks? We decided to answer this question and train our own language model from scratch.\nWe have made the following statements:\nwe use 1 consumer graphic card\nwe train the model only with the Polish corpus\nwe use manually selected, high quality texts for training the model.\nWhy have we made such statements? It is worth noting that training a model requires several times more resources than using it. To put it simply, it can be assumed that it is about 3-4 times more. Therefore, if a model can be run with a graphic card that has 6 GB VRAM, then training this model requires about 24 GB VRAM (this is the minimum value).\nMany consumer computers are equipped with good quality graphic cards that can be used for training a model at one’s own home. This is why we have decided to use a top consumer graphic card - Nvidia’s RTX 4090 24GB VRAM.\nAll the currently available language models have been trained mainly with English corpora with a little bit of other languages, including Polish. The effect is that these models are not the best at dealing with the Polish texts. Even the popular GPT models from OpenAI and Bard from Google often have issues with correct forms. Therefore we have decided to prepare a model based only on the Polish corpus. An additional advantage of using only the Polish corpus is the size of the model - it is better to focus on one language in the case of smaller models.\nIt is important to remember that models are only as good as the data with which they are trained. Given the small size of the model, we trained it with carefully selected texts. This is why we have not used corpora such as Common Crawl that contain a lot of poor-quality data. With close collaboration and advice from the Speakleash team, our team has prepared over 285GB of Polish language text corpus that has then been processed and used for training the model. Additionally, the unique feature of our model is that it has been trained on the largest amount of text among all available models for the Polish language.\nModel\nAPT3-1B-Base has been trained with the use of an original open source framework called ALLaMo. This framework allows the user to train language models similar to the Meta AI’s LLaMA models quickly and efficiently.\nAPT3-1B-Base is an autoregressive language model based on the architecture of a transformer. It has been trained with data collected before the end of December 2023.\nThe training dataset (the Polish corpus) has over 60 billion tokens, and we use all of them for training with one epoch.\nA special tokenizer has been prepared and trained for the purpose of training the models in the APT3 series.\nModel description:\nDeveloped by: Azurro\nLanguage: Polish\nModel type: causal decoder-only\nLicense: CC BY NC 4.0 (non-commercial use)\nModel details:\nHyperparameter Value\nModel Parameters 1041M\nSequence Length 2048\nVocabulary Size 31980\nLayers 18\nHeads 32\nd_head 64\nd_model 2048\nDropout 0.0\nBias No\nPositional Encoding RoPE\nActivation Function SwiGLU\nNormalizing Function RMSNorm\nIntermediate Size 5504\nNorm Epsilon 1e-06\nTokenizer details:\ntype: BPE\nspecial tokens: 8 (<unk>, <s>, </s>, <pad>, [INST], [/INST], <<SYS>>, <</SYS>>)\nalphabet size: 113\nvocabulary size: 31980\nTraining\nFramework: ALLaMo\nVisualizations: W&B\nTraining hyperparameters:\nHyperparameter Value\nMicro Batch Size 1\nGradient Accumulation Steps 1024\nBatch Size 2097152\nLearning Rate (cosine) 2e-04 -> 2e-05\nWarmup Iterations 1000\nAll Iterations 28900\nOptimizer AdamW\nβ1, β2 0.9, 0.95\nAdam_eps 1e−8\nWeight Decay 0.1\nGrad Clip 1.0\nPrecision bfloat16\nDataset\nCollecting a large amount of high quality training data is a great challenge. Over the past years at Azurro, we have done a lot of projects connected with processing Big Data. Therefore, with our extensive experience, we have been able to prepare carefully selected training dataset quickly and efficiently.\nOur close collaboration with the Speakleash team has resulted in the creation of over 285GB of the Polish language text corpus. The process of preparing the training dataset involved transforming documents by applying various cleaning and repairing rules, followed by selecting documents of appropriate quality.\nOur training dataset contains:\n150 datasets from Speakleash - 93%\nother publicly available and crawled web data - 6%\nPolish Wikipedia - 1%\nQuickstart\nThis model can be easily loaded using the AutoModelForCausalLM functionality.\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\nmodel_name = \"Azurro/APT3-1B-Base\"\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\nIn order to reduce the memory usage, you can use smaller precision (bfloat16).\nimport torch\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)\nAnd then you can use Hugging Face Pipelines to generate text:\nimport transformers\n\ntext = \"Najważniejszym celem człowieka na ziemi jest\"\n\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)\nsequences = pipeline(max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True, top_k=50, eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id, text_inputs=text)\nfor seq in sequences:\n    print(f\"Result: {seq['generated_text']}\")\nGenerated output:\nNajważniejszym celem człowieka na ziemi jest życie w pokoju, harmonii i miłości. Dla każdego z nas bardzo ważne jest, aby otaczać się kochanymi osobami.\nLimitations and Biases\nAPT3-1B-Base is not intended for deployment without fine-tuning. It should not be used for human-facing interactions without further guardrails and user consent.\nAPT3-1B-Base can produce factually incorrect output, and should not be relied on to produce factually accurate information. APT3-1B-Base was trained on various public datasets. While great efforts have been taken to clean the pretraining data, it is possible that this model could generate lewd, biased or otherwise offensive outputs.\nLicense\nBecause of an unclear legal situation, we have decided to publish the model under CC BY NC 4.0 license - it allows for non-commercial use. The model can be used for scientific purposes and privately, as long as the license conditions are met.\nDisclaimer\nThe license on this model does not constitute legal advice.

I also didn't want to randomly select a single prompt format for each item (hoping each instruction would generalize more when used in a variety of prompt formats), so each instruction is actually converted into every prompt format.\nThis means each epoch of our fine-tune is really basically 4 epochs. So, for the fine-tunes, I would recommend only doing 1 epoch (or 0.75 epochs). I am testing with a single epoch using a relatively low learning rate.\nAlpaca (sort of)\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task.

The model was also tuned to limit the values to the provided context as much as possible to reduce hallucinations.\nThe format for a contextual prompt is as follows:\nBEGININPUT\nBEGINCONTEXT\n[key0: value0]\n[key1: value1]\n... other metdata ...\nENDCONTEXT\n[insert your text blocks here]\nENDINPUT\n[add as many other blocks, in the exact same format]\nBEGININSTRUCTION\n[insert your instruction(s).  The model was tuned with single questions, paragraph format, lists, etc.]\nENDINSTRUCTION\nI know it's a bit verbose and annoying, but after much trial and error, using these explicit delimiters helps the model understand where to find the responses and how to associate specific sources with it.\nBEGININPUT - denotes a new input block\nBEGINCONTEXT - denotes the block of context (metadata key/value pairs) to associate with the current input block\nENDCONTEXT - denotes the end of the metadata block for the current input\n[text] - Insert whatever text you want for the input block, as many paragraphs as can fit in the context.\nENDINPUT - denotes the end of the current input block\n[repeat as many input blocks in this format as you want]\nBEGININSTRUCTION - denotes the start of the list (or one) instruction(s) to respond to for all of the input blocks above.\n[instruction(s)]\nENDINSTRUCTION - denotes the end of instruction set\nUse a very low temperature!\nHere's a trivial, but important example to prove the point:\nBEGININPUT\nBEGINCONTEXT\ndate: 2021-01-01\nurl: https://web.site/123\nENDCONTEXT\nIn a shocking turn of events, blueberries are now green, but will be sticking with the same name.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nWhat color are bluberries?  Source?\nENDINSTRUCTION\nAnd the response:\nBlueberries are now green.\nSource:\ndate: 2021-01-01\nurl: https://web.site/123\nSummarization\n500 samples have been included from this dataset, using the same format as contextual question answering, for example:\nBEGININPUT\n{text to summarize}\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 130 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION\nAgent/function calling\nThe dataset includes many examples of function/args generation based on input criteria. This is somewhat similar to the OpenAI function calling, but the output is either JSON or YAML.\nExample prompt:\nAs an AI assistant, please select the most suitable function and parameters from the list of available functions below, based on the user's input. Provide your response in JSON format.\n\nInput: I want to know how many times 'Python' is mentioned in my text file.\n\nAvailable functions:\nfile_analytics:\n  description: This tool performs various operations on a text file.\n  params:\n    action: The operation we want to perform on the data, such as \"count_occurrences\", \"find_line\", etc.\n    filters:\n      keyword: The word or phrase we want to search for.\nResponse:\n{\n  \"function\": \"file_analytics\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"action\": \"count_occurrences\",\n    \"filters\": {\n      \"keyword\": \"Python\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nreWOO style execution planning\nThe model now supports execution planning for complex instructions that would require making use of several tools. The output is just the plan, you must implement a mechanism to parse the output and actually call the functions!\nExample prompt:\nPlease construct a systematic plan to generate an optimal response to the user instruction, utilizing a set of provided tools. Each plan will correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string\nthat could be the user's question, one or more prior evidence values, or a combination of both.\n\nHere are the tools available to be called:\nDuckDuckGo[input]: Tool that enables the user to search for information using the DuckDuckGo search engine. This tool is helpful in locating a suitable list of sites that may contain the answer to the user's query. It does not directly answer the question but finds a list of sites that might have the answer.\nTextScraper[input]: Load one or more websites from the input string containing newline delimited links, where input is one or more links, and produces plain text output containing the content of the links.\nHyperlinkExtractor[input]: Extract links from plain text and produces a plain text, newline delimited response of links.\nKnowledgeModel[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text. The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g. What color is the cat, given :evidence1:?\n\nThe output should be in format:\nPlan: [first action to take based on input question]\n:evidence0: = [function to call with input parameter]\nPlan: [next action to take, based on result of :evidence0:]\n:evidence1: = [next function to call and input parameter, which may include reference to previous evidence, e.g. \"Given context :evidence0\"]\n...\nAnswer: [:evidence[n]: containing the final answer.]\n\nQuestion: Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020 and what is their most famous work?\nResponse:\nPlan: Begin by conducting a web search to find out who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020.\n:evidence0: = DuckDuckGo[Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 winner]\nPlan: Utilize the KnowledgeModel to interpret the search results and find the name of the laureate.\n:evidence1: = KnowledgeModel[Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020, given :evidence0:?]\nPlan: Conduct another web search to find the most famous work of the identified laureate.\n:evidence2: = DuckDuckGo[Most famous work of :evidence1:]\nPlan: Extract the relevant links from the DuckDuckGo search results for a more focused search.\n:evidence3: = HyperlinkExtractor[:evidence2:]\nPlan: Use the TextScraper tool to extract information from the relevant links.\n:evidence4: = TextScraper[:evidence3:]\nPlan: Finally, utilize the KnowledgeModel to identify and summarize the most famous work of the laureate from the extracted information.\n:evidence5: = KnowledgeModel[What is the most famous work of :evidence1:, given :evidence4:?]\nAnswer: :evidence5:\nFor this to be useful, you'd have to parse the output plan text, and implement/call each of the functions.

The license used is MIT.\nModel Description\nMotivated by the success of T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) in pre-trained natural language processing models, we propose a unified-modal SpeechT5 framework that explores the encoder-decoder pre-training for self-supervised speech/text representation learning. The SpeechT5 framework consists of a shared encoder-decoder network and six modal-specific (speech/text) pre/post-nets. After preprocessing the input speech/text through the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output in the speech/text modality based on the output of the decoder.\nLeveraging large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for both speech and text. To align the textual and speech information into this unified semantic space, we propose a cross-modal vector quantization approach that randomly mixes up speech/text states with latent units as the interface between encoder and decoder.\nExtensive evaluations show the superiority of the proposed SpeechT5 framework on a wide variety of spoken language processing tasks, including automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, voice conversion, speech enhancement, and speaker identification.\nDeveloped by: Junyi Ao, Rui Wang, Long Zhou, Chengyi Wang, Shuo Ren, Yu Wu, Shujie Liu, Tom Ko, Qing Li, Yu Zhang, Zhihua Wei, Yao Qian, Jinyu Li, Furu Wei.\nShared by [optional]: Matthijs Hollemans\nModel type: text-to-speech\nLanguage(s) (NLP): [More Information Needed]\nLicense: MIT\nFinetuned from model [optional]: [More Information Needed]\nModel Sources [optional]\nRepository: [https://github.com/microsoft/SpeechT5/]\nPaper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07205.pdf]\nBlog Post: [https://huggingface.co/blog/speecht5]\nDemo: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/Matthijs/speecht5-tts-demo]\nUses\n🤗 Transformers Usage\nYou can run SpeechT5 TTS locally with the 🤗 Transformers library.\nFirst install the 🤗 Transformers library, sentencepiece, soundfile and datasets(optional):\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install --upgrade transformers sentencepiece datasets[audio]\nRun inference via the Text-to-Speech (TTS) pipeline.

Keep in mind that not all generated codes might be readable, but you can try different parameters and prompts to get the desired results.\nNEW VERSION\nIntroducing the upgraded version of our model - Controlnet QR code Monster v2. V2 is a huge upgrade over v1, for scannability AND creativity.\nQR codes can now seamlessly blend the image by using a gray-colored background (#808080).\nAs with the former version, the readability of some generated codes may vary, however playing around with parameters and prompts could yield better results.\nYou can find in in the v2/ subfolder.\nHow to Use\nCondition: QR codes are passed as condition images with a module size of 16px. Use a higher error correction level to make it easier to read (sometimes a lower level can be easier to read if smaller in size). Use a gray background for the rest of the image to make the code integrate better.\nPrompts: Use a prompt to guide the QR code generation. The output will highly depend on the given prompt. Some seem to be really easily accepted by the qr code process, some will require careful tweaking to get good results.\nControlnet guidance scale: Set the controlnet guidance scale value:\nHigh values: The generated QR code will be more readable.\nLow values: The generated QR code will be more creative.\nTips\nFor an optimally readable output, try generating multiple QR codes with similar parameters, then choose the best ones.\nUse the Image-to-Image feature to improve the readability of a generated QR code:\nDecrease the denoising strength to retain more of the original image.\nIncrease the controlnet guidance scale value for better readability. A typical workflow for \"saving\" a code would be : Max out the guidance scale and minimize the denoising strength, then bump the strength until the code scans.\nExample Outputs\nHere are some examples of creative, yet scannable QR codes produced by our model:\nFeel free to experiment with prompts, parameters, and the Image-to-Image feature to achieve the desired QR code output. Good luck and have fun!",

This approach offers a more efficient and compact method to bring model control to a wider variety of consumer GPUs.\nFor each model below, you'll find:\nRank 256 files (reducing the original 4.7GB ControlNet models down to ~738MB Control-LoRA models) and experimental\nRank 128 files (reducing to model down to ~377MB)\nEach Control-LoRA has been trained on a diverse range of image concepts and aspect ratios.\nMiDaS and ClipDrop Depth\nThis Control-LoRA utilizes a grayscale depth map for guided generation.\nDepth estimation is an image processing technique that determines the distance of objects in a scene, providing a depth map that highlights variations in proximity.\nThe model was trained on the depth results of MiDaS dpt_beit_large_512.\nIt was further finetuned on the Portrait Depth Estimation model available in the ClipDrop API by Stability AI.\nCanny Edge\nCanny Edge Detection is an image processing technique that identifies abrupt changes in intensity to highlight edges in an image.\nThis Control-LoRA uses the edges from an image to generate the final image.\nPhotograph and Sketch Colorizer\nThese two Control-LoRAs can be used to colorize images.\nRecolor is designed to colorize black and white photographs.\nSketch is designed to color in drawings input as a white-on-black image (either hand-drawn, or created with a pidi edge model).\nRevision\nRevision is a novel approach of using images to prompt SDXL.\nIt uses pooled CLIP embeddings to produce images conceptually similar to the input. It can be used either in addition, or to replace text prompts.\nRevision also includes a blending function for combining multiple image or text concepts, as either positive or negative prompts.\nInference\nControl-LoRAs have been implemented into ComfyUI and StableSwarmUI\nBasic ComfyUI workflows (using the base model only) are available in this HF repo.

This model was created in collaboration with Gryphe, a mixture of our Pygmalion-2 13B and Gryphe's Mythomax L2 13B.\nFiner details of the merge are available in our blogpost. According to our testers, this model seems to outperform MythoMax in RP/Chat. Please make sure you follow the recommended generation settings for SillyTavern here for the best results!\nThis model is freely available for both commercial and non-commercial use, as per the Llama-2 license.\nPrompting\nThis model can be prompted using both the Alpaca and Pygmalion formatting.\nAlpaca formatting:\n### Instruction:\n<prompt>\n\n### Response:\n<leave a newline blank for model to respond>\nPygmalion/Metharme formatting:\n<|system|>Enter RP mode. Pretend to be {{char}} whose persona follows:\n{{persona}}\n\nYou shall reply to the user while staying in character, and generate long responses.\n<|user|>Hello!<|model|>{model's response goes here}\nThe model has been trained on prompts using three different roles, which are denoted by the following tokens: <|system|>, <|user|> and <|model|>.\nThe <|system|> prompt can be used to inject out-of-channel information behind the scenes, while the <|user|> prompt should be used to indicate user input. The <|model|> token should then be used to indicate that the model should generate a response. These tokens can happen multiple times and be chained up to form a conversation history.\nLimitations and biases\nThe intended use-case for this model is fictional writing for entertainment purposes. Any other sort of usage is out of scope.\nAs such, it was not fine-tuned to be safe and harmless: the base model and this fine-tune have been trained on data known to contain profanity and texts that are lewd or otherwise offensive. It may produce socially unacceptable or undesirable text, even if the prompt itself does not include anything explicitly offensive. Outputs might often be factually wrong or misleading.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank SpicyChat for sponsoring the training for the Pygmalion-2 13B model.",
    "https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-1_5": "Model Summary\nThe language model Phi-1.5 is a Transformer with 1.3 billion parameters. It was trained using the same data sources as phi-1, augmented with a new data source that consists of various NLP synthetic texts. When assessed against benchmarks testing common sense, language understanding, and logical reasoning, Phi-1.5 demonstrates a nearly state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 10 billion parameters.\nWe did not fine-tune Phi-1.5 either for instruction following or through reinforcement learning from human feedback. The intention behind crafting this open-source model is to provide the research community with a non-restricted small model to explore vital safety challenges, such as reducing toxicity, understanding societal biases, enhancing controllability, and more.\nFor a safer model release, we exclude generic web-crawl data sources such as common-crawl from the training. This strategy prevents direct exposure to potentially harmful online content, enhancing the model's safety without RLHF. However, the model is still vulnerable to generating harmful content. We hope the model can help the research community to further study the safety of language models.\nPhi-1.5 can write poems, draft emails, create stories, summarize texts, write Python code (such as downloading a Hugging Face transformer model), etc.\nIntended Uses\nGiven the nature of the training data, Phi-1.5 is best suited for prompts using the QA format, the chat format, and the code format. Note that Phi-1.5, being a base model, often produces irrelevant text following the main answer. In the following example, we've truncated the answer for illustrative purposes only.\nQA Format:\nWrite a detailed analogy between mathematics and a lighthouse.\n\nAnswer: Mathematics is like a lighthouse, guiding us through the vast ocean of numbers and calculations. Just as a lighthouse illuminates the darkness, mathematics provides us with a clear path to navigate through complex problems. It helps us make sense of the world around us, just like a lighthouse helps ships find their way home.\nwhere the model generates the text after \"Answer:\".\nChat Format:\nAlice: I don't know why, I'm struggling to maintain focus while studying. Any suggestions?\n\nBob: Have you tried using a timer? It can help you stay on track and avoid distractions.\n\nAlice: That's a good idea. I'll give it a try.\n\nCharlie: Another thing that can help is to break up your study sessions into smaller chunks. It's easier to concentrate on one thing at a time.\n\nAlice: That makes sense. I'll try that too.\n\nBob: And don't forget to take breaks! It's important to give your brain a rest so you can come back to your studies with a fresh perspective.\n\nAlice: Thanks for the advice, guys. I feel more motivated now.\n\nCharlie: No problem, Alice. We're all in this together.\n\nBob: Yeah, and remember that it's okay to ask for help if you need it. We're here to support each other.\nwhere the model generates the text after the first \"Bob:\".\nCode Format:\ndef print_prime(n):\n   \"\"\"\n   Print all primes between 1 and n\n   \"\"\"\n   primes = []\n   for num in range(2, n+1):\n       is_prime = True\n       for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num))+1):\n           if num % i == 0:\n               is_prime = False\n               break\n       if is_prime:\n           primes.append(num)\n   print(primes)\nwhere the model generates the text after the comments.\nNotes:\nPhi-1.5 is intended for research purposes. The model-generated text/code should be treated as a starting point rather than a definitive solution for potential use cases. Users should be cautious when employing these models in their applications.\nDirect adoption for production tasks is out of the scope of this research project. As a result, Phi-1.5 has not been tested to ensure that it performs adequately for any production-level application. Please refer to the limitation sections of this document for more details.\nIf you are using transformers>=4.36.0, always load the model with trust_remote_code=True to prevent side-effects.\nSample Code\nThere are four types of execution mode:\nFP16 / Flash-Attention / CUDA:\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-1_5\", torch_dtype=\"auto\", flash_attn=True, flash_rotary=True, fused_dense=True, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True)\nFP16 / CUDA:\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-1_5\", torch_dtype=\"auto\", device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True)\nFP32 / CUDA:\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-1_5\", torch_dtype=torch.float32, device_map=\"cuda\", trust_remote_code=True)\nFP32 / CPU:\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-1_5\", torch_dtype=torch.float32, device_map=\"cpu\", trust_remote_code=True)\nTo ensure the maximum compatibility, we recommend using the second execution mode (FP16 / CUDA), as follows:\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\ntorch.set_default_device(\"cuda\")\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-1_5\", torch_dtype=\"auto\", trust_remote_code=True)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/phi-1_5\", trust_remote_code=True)\n\ninputs = tokenizer('''def print_prime(n):\n   \"\"\"\n   Print all primes between 1 and n\n   \"\"\"''', return_tensors=\"pt\", return_attention_mask=False)\n\noutputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=200)\ntext = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)[0]\nprint(text)\nRemark: In the generation function, our model currently does not support beam search (num_beams > 1). Furthermore, in the forward pass of the model, we currently do not support outputting hidden states or attention values, or using custom input embeddings.\nLimitations of Phi-1.5\nGenerate Inaccurate Code and Facts: The model often produces incorrect code snippets and statements. Users should treat these outputs as suggestions or starting points, not as definitive or accurate solutions.\nLimited Scope for code: If the model generates Python scripts that utilize uncommon packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nUnreliable Responses to Instruction: The model has not undergone instruction fine-tuning. As a result, it may struggle or fail to adhere to intricate or nuanced instructions provided by users.\nLanguage Limitations: The model is primarily designed to understand standard English. Informal English, slang, or any other language outside of English might pose challenges to its comprehension, leading to potential misinterpretations or errors in response.\nPotential Societal Biases: Regardless of the safe data used for its training, the model is not entirely free from societal biases. There's a possibility it may generate content that mirrors these societal biases, particularly if prompted or instructed to do so. We urge users to be aware of this and to exercise caution and critical thinking when interpreting model outputs.\nToxicity: Despite that the model is trained with carefully selected data, the model can still produce harmful content if explicitly prompted or instructed to do so. We chose to release the model for research purposes only -- We hope to help the open-source community develop the most effective ways to reduce the toxicity of a model directly after pretraining.\nTraining\nModel\nArchitecture: a Transformer-based model with next-word prediction objective\nDataset size: 30B tokens\nTraining tokens: 150B tokens\nPrecision: fp16\nGPUs: 32xA100-40G\nTraining time: 8 days\nSoftware\nPyTorch\nDeepSpeed\nFlash-Attention\nLicense\nThe model is licensed under the Research License.\nCitation\nYou can find the paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05463\n@article{textbooks2,\n  title={Textbooks Are All You Need II: \\textbf{phi-1.5} technical report},\n  author={Li, Yuanzhi and Bubeck, S{\\'e}bastien and Eldan, Ronen and Del Giorno, Allie and Gunasekar, Suriya and Lee, Yin Tat},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.05463},\n  year={2023}\n}",

The similarity score between two dissimilar sentences is higher than 0.5\n3. When does the query instruction need to be used\nUsage\nUsage for Embedding Model\nHere are some examples for using bge models with FlagEmbedding, Sentence-Transformers, Langchain, or Huggingface Transformers.\nUsing FlagEmbedding\npip install -U FlagEmbedding\nIf it doesn't work for you, you can see FlagEmbedding for more methods to install FlagEmbedding.\nfrom FlagEmbedding import FlagModel\nsentences_1 = [\"样例数据-1\", \"样例数据-2\"]\nsentences_2 = [\"样例数据-3\", \"样例数据-4\"]\nmodel = FlagModel('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5', \n                  query_instruction_for_retrieval=\"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\",\n                  use_fp16=True) # Setting use_fp16 to True speeds up computation with a slight performance degradation\nembeddings_1 = model.encode(sentences_1)\nembeddings_2 = model.encode(sentences_2)\nsimilarity = embeddings_1 @ embeddings_2.T\nprint(similarity)\n\n# for s2p(short query to long passage) retrieval task, suggest to use encode_queries() which will automatically add the instruction to each query\n# corpus in retrieval task can still use encode() or encode_corpus(), since they don't need instruction\nqueries = ['query_1', 'query_2']\npassages = [\"样例文档-1\", \"样例文档-2\"]\nq_embeddings = model.encode_queries(queries)\np_embeddings = model.encode(passages)\nscores = q_embeddings @ p_embeddings.T\nFor the value of the argument query_instruction_for_retrieval, see Model List.\nBy default, FlagModel will use all available GPUs when encoding. Please set os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] to select specific GPUs. You also can set os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"]=\"\" to make all GPUs unavailable.\nUsing Sentence-Transformers\nYou can also use the bge models with sentence-transformers:\npip install -U sentence-transformers\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nsentences_1 = [\"样例数据-1\", \"样例数据-2\"]\nsentences_2 = [\"样例数据-3\", \"样例数据-4\"]\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nembeddings_1 = model.encode(sentences_1, normalize_embeddings=True)\nembeddings_2 = model.encode(sentences_2, normalize_embeddings=True)\nsimilarity = embeddings_1 @ embeddings_2.T\nprint(similarity)\nFor s2p(short query to long passage) retrieval task, each short query should start with an instruction (instructions see Model List). But the instruction is not needed for passages.\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nqueries = ['query_1', 'query_2']\npassages = [\"样例文档-1\", \"样例文档-2\"]\ninstruction = \"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\"\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nq_embeddings = model.encode([instruction+q for q in queries], normalize_embeddings=True)\np_embeddings = model.encode(passages, normalize_embeddings=True)\nscores = q_embeddings @ p_embeddings.T\nUsing Langchain\nYou can use bge in langchain like this:\nfrom langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings\nmodel_name = \"BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5\"\nmodel_kwargs = {'device': 'cuda'}\nencode_kwargs = {'normalize_embeddings': True} # set True to compute cosine similarity\nmodel = HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings(\n    model_name=model_name,\n    model_kwargs=model_kwargs,\n    encode_kwargs=encode_kwargs,\n    query_instruction=\"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\"\n)\nmodel.query_instruction = \"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\"\nUsing HuggingFace Transformers\nWith the transformers package, you can use the model like this: First, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you select the last hidden state of the first token (i.e., [CLS]) as the sentence embedding.\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\nimport torch\n# Sentences we want sentence embeddings for\nsentences = [\"样例数据-1\", \"样例数据-2\"]\n\n# Load model from HuggingFace Hub\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nmodel.eval()\n\n# Tokenize sentences\nencoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n# for s2p(short query to long passage) retrieval task, add an instruction to query (not add instruction for passages)\n# encoded_input = tokenizer([instruction + q for q in queries], padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n\n# Compute token embeddings\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    model_output = model(**encoded_input)\n    # Perform pooling. In this case, cls pooling.\n    sentence_embeddings = model_output[0][:, 0]\n# normalize embeddings\nsentence_embeddings = torch.nn.functional.normalize(sentence_embeddings, p=2, dim=1)\nprint(\"Sentence embeddings:\", sentence_embeddings)\nUsage for Reranker\nDifferent from embedding model, reranker uses question and document as input and directly output similarity instead of embedding. You can get a relevance score by inputting query and passage to the reranker. The reranker is optimized based cross-entropy loss, so the relevance score is not bounded to a specific range.\nUsing FlagEmbedding\npip install -U FlagEmbedding\nGet relevance scores (higher scores indicate more relevance):\nfrom FlagEmbedding import FlagReranker\nreranker = FlagReranker('BAAI/bge-reranker-large', use_fp16=True) # Setting use_fp16 to True speeds up computation with a slight performance degradation\n\nscore = reranker.compute_score(['query', 'passage'])\nprint(score)\n\nscores = reranker.compute_score([['what is panda?', 'hi'], ['what is panda?', 'The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), sometimes called a panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China.']])\nprint(scores)\nUsing Huggingface transformers\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-reranker-large')\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-reranker-large')\nmodel.eval()\n\npairs = [['what is panda?', 'hi'], ['what is panda?', 'The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), sometimes called a panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China.']]\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    inputs = tokenizer(pairs, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt', max_length=512)\n    scores = model(**inputs, return_dict=True).logits.view(-1, ).float()\n    print(scores)\nEvaluation\nbaai-general-embedding models achieve state-of-the-art performance on both MTEB and C-MTEB leaderboard!

You can fine-tune the embedding model on your data following our examples. We also provide a pre-train example. Note that the goal of pre-training is to reconstruct the text, and the pre-trained model cannot be used for similarity calculation directly, it needs to be fine-tuned. More training details for bge see baai_general_embedding.\nBGE Reranker\nCross-encoder will perform full-attention over the input pair, which is more accurate than embedding model (i.e., bi-encoder) but more time-consuming than embedding model. Therefore, it can be used to re-rank the top-k documents returned by embedding model. We train the cross-encoder on a multilingual pair data, The data format is the same as embedding model, so you can fine-tune it easily following our example.

But the instruction is not needed for passages.\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nqueries = ['query_1', 'query_2']\npassages = [\"样例文档-1\", \"样例文档-2\"]\ninstruction = \"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\"\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nq_embeddings = model.encode([instruction+q for q in queries], normalize_embeddings=True)\np_embeddings = model.encode(passages, normalize_embeddings=True)\nscores = q_embeddings @ p_embeddings.T\nUsing Langchain\nYou can use bge in langchain like this:\nfrom langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings\nmodel_name = \"BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5\"\nmodel_kwargs = {'device': 'cuda'}\nencode_kwargs = {'normalize_embeddings': True} # set True to compute cosine similarity\nmodel = HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings(\n    model_name=model_name,\n    model_kwargs=model_kwargs,\n    encode_kwargs=encode_kwargs,\n    query_instruction=\"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\"\n)\nmodel.query_instruction = \"为这个句子生成表示以用于检索相关文章：\"\nUsing HuggingFace Transformers\nWith the transformers package, you can use the model like this: First, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you select the last hidden state of the first token (i.e., [CLS]) as the sentence embedding.\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\nimport torch\n# Sentences we want sentence embeddings for\nsentences = [\"样例数据-1\", \"样例数据-2\"]\n\n# Load model from HuggingFace Hub\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')\nmodel.eval()\n\n# Tokenize sentences\nencoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n# for s2p(short query to long passage) retrieval task, add an instruction to query (not add instruction for passages)\n# encoded_input = tokenizer([instruction + q for q in queries], padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n\n# Compute token embeddings\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    model_output = model(**encoded_input)\n    # Perform pooling. In this case, cls pooling.\n    sentence_embeddings = model_output[0][:, 0]\n# normalize embeddings\nsentence_embeddings = torch.nn.functional.normalize(sentence_embeddings, p=2, dim=1)\nprint(\"Sentence embeddings:\", sentence_embeddings)\nUsage for Reranker\nDifferent from embedding model, reranker uses question and document as input and directly output similarity instead of embedding. You can get a relevance score by inputting query and passage to the reranker. The reranker is optimized based cross-entropy loss, so the relevance score is not bounded to a specific range.\nUsing FlagEmbedding\npip install -U FlagEmbedding\nGet relevance scores (higher scores indicate more relevance):\nfrom FlagEmbedding import FlagReranker\nreranker = FlagReranker('BAAI/bge-reranker-large', use_fp16=True) # Setting use_fp16 to True speeds up computation with a slight performance degradation\n\nscore = reranker.compute_score(['query', 'passage'])\nprint(score)\n\nscores = reranker.compute_score([['what is panda?', 'hi'], ['what is panda?', 'The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), sometimes called a panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China.']])\nprint(scores)\nUsing Huggingface transformers\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-reranker-large')\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-reranker-large')\nmodel.eval()\n\npairs = [['what is panda?', 'hi'], ['what is panda?', 'The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), sometimes called a panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China.']]\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    inputs = tokenizer(pairs, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt', max_length=512)\n    scores = model(**inputs, return_dict=True).logits.view(-1, ).float()\n    print(scores)\nEvaluation\nbaai-general-embedding models achieve state-of-the-art performance on both MTEB and C-MTEB leaderboard!

You can fine-tune the embedding model on your data following our examples. We also provide a pre-train example. Note that the goal of pre-training is to reconstruct the text, and the pre-trained model cannot be used for similarity calculation directly, it needs to be fine-tuned. More training details for bge see baai_general_embedding.\nBGE Reranker\nCross-encoder will perform full-attention over the input pair, which is more accurate than embedding model (i.e., bi-encoder) but more time-consuming than embedding model. Therefore, it can be used to re-rank the top-k documents returned by embedding model. We train the cross-encoder on a multilingual pair data, The data format is the same as embedding model, so you can fine-tune it easily following our example.

You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the Stability AI endorses you or your use.\nContact: For questions and comments about the model, please email lm@stability.ai\nModel Architecture\nThe model is a decoder-only transformer similar to the LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) architecture with the following modifications:\nParameters Hidden Size Layers Heads Sequence Length\n2,795,443,200 2560 32 32 4096\nPosition Embeddings: Rotary Position Embeddings (Su et al., 2021) applied to the first 25% of head embedding dimensions for improved throughput following Black et al. (2022).\nNormalization: LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) with learned bias terms as opposed to RMSNorm (Zhang & Sennrich, 2019).\nTokenizer: GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022).\nTraining\nFor complete dataset and training details, please see the StableLM-3B-4E1T Technical Report.\nTraining Dataset\nThe dataset is comprised of a filtered mixture of open-source large-scale datasets available on the HuggingFace Hub: Falcon RefinedWeb extract (Penedo et al., 2023), RedPajama-Data (Together Computer., 2023) and The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) both without the Books3 subset, and StarCoder (Li et al., 2023).\nGiven the large amount of web data, we recommend fine-tuning the base StableLM-3B-4E1T for your downstream tasks.\nTraining Procedure\nThe model is pre-trained on the aforementioned datasets in bfloat16 precision, optimized with AdamW, and trained using the NeoX tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 50,257. We outline the complete hyperparameters choices in the project's GitHub repository - config.\nTraining Infrastructure\nHardware: StableLM-3B-4E1T was trained on the Stability AI cluster across 256 NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs (AWS P4d instances). Training began on August 23, 2023, and took approximately 30 days to complete.\nSoftware: We use a fork of gpt-neox (EleutherAI, 2021), train under 2D parallelism (Data and Tensor Parallel) with ZeRO-1 (Rajbhandari et al., 2019), and rely on flash-attention as well as SwiGLU and Rotary Embedding kernels from FlashAttention-2 (Dao et al., 2023)\nUse and Limitations\nIntended Use\nThe model is intended to be used as a foundational base model for application-specific fine-tuning. Developers must evaluate and fine-tune the model for safe performance in downstream applications.\nLimitations and Bias\nAs a base model, this model may exhibit unreliable, unsafe, or other undesirable behaviors that must be corrected through evaluation and fine-tuning prior to deployment. The pre-training dataset may have contained offensive or inappropriate content, even after applying data cleansing filters, which can be reflected in the model-generated text. We recommend that users exercise caution when using these models in production systems. Do not use the models if they are unsuitable for your application, or for any applications that may cause deliberate or unintentional harm to others.\nHow to Cite\n@misc{StableLM-3B-4E1T,\n      url={[https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-3b-4e1t](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-3b-4e1t)},\n      title={StableLM 3B 4E1T},\n      author={Tow, Jonathan and Bellagente, Marco and Mahan, Dakota and Riquelme, Carlos}\n}",

    "https://huggingface.co/amazon/MistralLite": "MistralLite Model\nMistralLite is a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.1 language model, with enhanced capabilities of processing long context (up to 32K tokens). By utilizing an adapted Rotary Embedding and sliding window during fine-tuning, MistralLite is able to perform significantly better on several long context retrieve and answering tasks, while keeping the simple model structure of the original model. MistralLite is useful for applications such as long context line and topic retrieval, summarization, question-answering, and etc. MistralLite can be deployed on a single AWS g5.2x instance with Sagemaker Huggingface Text Generation Inference (TGI) endpoint, making it suitable for applications that require high performance in resource-constrained environments. You can also serve the MistralLite model directly using TGI docker containers. Also, MistralLite supports other ways of serving like vLLM, and you can use MistralLite in Python by using the HuggingFace transformers and FlashAttention-2 library.\nMistralLite is similar to Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1, and their similarities and differences are summarized below:\nModel Fine-tuned on long contexts Max context length RotaryEmbedding adaptation Sliding Window Size\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 up to 8K tokens 32K rope_theta = 10000 4096\nMistralLite up to 16K tokens 32K rope_theta = 1000000 16384\nImportant - Use the prompt template below for MistralLite:\n<|prompter|>What are the main challenges to support a long context for LLM?</s><|assistant|>\nMotivation of Developing MistralLite\nSince the release of Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1, the model became increasingly popular because its strong performance on a wide range of benchmarks. But most of the benchmarks are evaluated on short context, and not much has been investigated on its performance on long context tasks. Then We evaluated Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 against benchmarks that are specifically designed to assess the capabilities of LLMs in handling longer context. Although the performance of the models on long context was fairly competitive on long context less than 4096 tokens, there were some limitations on its performance on longer context. Motivated by improving its performance on longer context, we finetuned the Mistral 7B model, and produced Mistrallite. The model managed to significantly boost the performance of long context handling over Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1. The detailed long context evalutaion results are as below:\nTopic Retrieval\nModel Name Input length Input length Input length Input length Input length\n2851 5568 8313 11044 13780\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 100% 50% 2% 0% 0%\nMistralLite 100% 100% 100% 100% 98%\nLine Retrieval\nModel Name Input length Input length Input length Input length Input length Input length\n3818 5661 7505 9354 11188 12657\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 98% 62% 42% 42% 32% 30%\nMistralLite 98% 92% 88% 76% 70% 60%\nPass key Retrieval\nModel Name Input length Input length Input length Input length\n3264 5396 8329 10197\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 100% 50% 20% 30%\nMistralLite 100% 100% 100% 100%\nQuestion Answering with Long Input Texts\nModel Name Test set Accuracy Hard subset Accuracy\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 44.3% 39.7%\nMistralLite 64.4% 56.2%\nExample test on long context of 13400 tokens\nContext is from Amazon Aurora FAQs\nQuestion: please tell me how does pgvector help with Generative AI and give me some examples.\nAnswer from MistralLite:\npgvector is an open-source extension for PostgreSQL supported by Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition.\n\nYou can use pgvector to store, search, index, and query billions of embeddings that are generated from machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models in your database, such as those from Amazon Bedrock (limited preview) or Amazon SageMaker. A vector embedding is a numerical representation that represents the semantic meaning of content such as text, images, and video.\n\nWith pgvector, you can query embeddings in your Aurora PostgreSQL database to perform efficient semantic similarity searches of these data types, represented as vectors, combined with other tabular data in Aurora. This enables the use of generative AI and other AI/ML systems for new types of applications such as personalized recommendations based on similar text descriptions or images, candidate match based on interview notes, customer service next best action recommendations based on successful transcripts or chat session dialogs, and more.\nModel Details\nDeveloped by: AWS Contributors\nModel type: Mistral-7B-v0.1\nLanguage: English\nFinetuned from weights: Mistral-7B-v0.1\nFinetuned on data:\nSLidingEncoder and Decoder (SLED)\n(Long) Natural Questions (NQ)\nOpenAssistant Conversations Dataset (OASST1)\nSupported Serving Framework:\nText-Generation-Inference 1.1.0\nvLLM\nHuggingFace transformers\nHuggingFace Text Generation Inference (TGI) container on SageMaker\nModel License: Apache 2.0\nContact: GitHub issues\nInference Code Github Repo\nMistralLite LM-Eval Results\nMethodology\nPlease see https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard\nrevision=4ececff\nNote: we used --model hf-causal-experimental instead of --model hf-causal\nResults\nAverage hellaswag arc_challenge truthful_qa (mc2) MMLU (acc)\n0.57221 0.81617 0.58874 0.38275 0.5012\nHow to Use MistralLite from Python Code (HuggingFace transformers)\nImportant - For an end-to-end example Jupyter notebook, please refer to this link.\nInstall the necessary packages\nRequires: transformers 4.34.0 or later, flash-attn 2.3.1.post1 or later, and accelerate 0.23.0 or later.\npip install transformers==4.34.0\npip install flash-attn==2.3.1.post1 --no-build-isolation\npip install accelerate==0.23.0\nYou can then try the following example code\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nimport transformers\nimport torch\n\nmodel_id = \"amazon/MistralLite\"\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id,\n                                             torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n                                             use_flash_attention_2=True,\n                                             device_map=\"auto\",)\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n    \"text-generation\",\n    model=model,\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n)\nprompt = \"<|prompter|>What are the main challenges to support a long context for LLM?</s><|assistant|>\"\n\nsequences = pipeline(\n    prompt,\n    max_new_tokens=400,\n    do_sample=False,\n    return_full_text=False,\n    num_return_sequences=1,\n    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,\n)\nfor seq in sequences:\n    print(f\"{seq['generated_text']}\")\nImportant - Use the prompt template below for MistralLite:\n<|prompter|>What are the main challenges to support a long context for LLM?</s><|assistant|>\nHow to Serve MistralLite on TGI\nImportant:\nFor an end-to-end example Jupyter notebook using the native TGI container, please refer to this link.\nIf the input context length is greater than 12K tokens, it is recommended using a custom TGI container, please refer to this link.\nStart TGI server\nUse TGI version 1.1.0 or later.

To this end, we have evaluated StableLM Zephyr 3B on 488 malicious prompts and used standard protocols to assess the harmfulness of its outputs. Compared to Zephyr-7b-β, StableLM Zephyr 3B reduces the number of harmful outputs as assessed by GPT-4 by 55. Additionally, we performed an internal red teaming event targeting the following abuse areas:\nSelf-Harm Methods: (Suicide Methods, Encouragement of Self-Harm, Methods and encouragement of Eating Disorders)\nMisinformation: (Health, Conspiracy Theories, Social Unrest/Conflict, Political Misinformation, & Climate change)\nHate Speech: (Race, Stereotypes, Immigrants, Gender, Personally Identifiable Information such as Social security numbers, Full names, ID numbers, Email addresses, and telephone numbers)\nWe have incorporated the findings of our malicious prompts evaluation and red teaming event into our release. Users are encouraged to fine-tune and evaluate the model to suit their specific needs, considering the potential biases and limitations found in StableLM Zephyr 3B and inherent in other LLM models.\nUse and Limitations\nIntended Use\nThe model is intended to be used as a foundational base model for application-specific fine-tuning. Developers must evaluate and fine-tune the model for safe performance in downstream applications.\nLimitations and Bias\nThis model is not trained against adversarial inputs. We strongly recommend pairing this model with an input and output classifier to prevent harmful responses.\nThrough our internal red teaming, we discovered that while the model will not output harmful information if not prompted to do so, it is willing to output potentially harmful outputs or misinformation when the user requests it. Using this model will require guardrails around your inputs and outputs to ensure that any outputs returned are not misinformation or harmful. Additionally, as each use case is unique, we recommend running your own suite of tests to ensure proper performance of this model. Finally, do not use the models if they are unsuitable for your application, or for any applications that may cause deliberate or unintentional harm to others.",

Upon conducting a more in-depth investigation of this difference, we have discovered that various models may employ different prompts, post-processing strategies, and sampling techniques, potentially resulting in significant variations in the outcomes. Our prompt and post-processing strategy remains consistent with the original benchmark, and greedy decoding is employed during evaluation without any post-processing for the generated content. For scores that were not reported by the original authors (including scores reported with different settings), we try to get results with our pipeline.\nTo evaluate the model's capability extensively, we adopted the methodology outlined in Llama2. Specifically, we included PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC, OBQA, and CSQA to assess common sense reasoning. SquAD, QuAC, and BoolQ were incorporated to evaluate reading comprehension. CSQA was exclusively tested using a 7-shot setup, while all other tests were conducted with a 0-shot configuration. Additionally, we introduced GSM8K (8-shot@1), MATH (4-shot@1), HumanEval (0-shot@1), and MBPP (3-shot@1) under the category \"Math & Code\". Due to technical constraints, we did not test Falcon-180 on QuAC and OBQA; the score is derived by averaging the scores on the remaining tasks. Since the scores for these two tasks are generally lower than the average, we believe that Falcon-180B's performance was not underestimated.\n📊 Chat model performance\nModel MMLU MMLU CMMLU CMMLU C-Eval(val)* C-Eval(val)* Truthful QA BBH BBH GSM8k GSM8k\n0-shot 5-shot 0-shot 5-shot 0-shot 5-shot 0-shot 0-shot 3-shot 0-shot 4-shot\nLLaMA2-13B-Chat 50.88 47.33 27.47 35.08 27.93 35.88 36.84 32.90 58.22 36.85 2.73\nLLaMA2-70B-Chat 59.42 59.86 36.10 40.99 34.99 41.31 53.95 42.36 58.53 47.08 58.68\nBaichuan2-13B-Chat 55.09 50.14 58.64 59.47 56.02 54.75 48.98 38.81 47.15 45.72 23.28\nQwen-14B-Chat 63.99 64.98 67.73 70.57 66.12 70.06 52.49 49.65 54.98 59.51 61.18\nInternLM-Chat-20B 55.55 57.42 53.55 53.75 51.19 53.57 51.75 42.41 36.68 15.69 43.44\nAquilaChat2-34B v1.2 65.15 66.70 67.51 70.02 82.99 89.38 64.33 20.12 34.28 11.52 48.45\nYi-6B-Chat 58.24 60.99 69.44 74.71 68.80 74.22 50.58 39.70 47.15 38.44 44.88\nYi-6B-Chat-8bits(GPTQ) 58.29 60.96 69.21 74.69 69.17 73.85 49.85 40.35 47.26 39.42 44.88\nYi-6B-Chat-4bits(AWQ) 56.78 59.89 67.70 73.29 67.53 72.29 50.29 37.74 43.62 35.71 38.36\nYi-34B-Chat 67.62 73.46 79.11 81.34 77.04 78.53 62.43 51.41 71.74 71.65 75.97\nYi-34B-Chat-8bits(GPTQ) 66.24 73.69 79.05 81.23 76.82 78.97 61.84 52.08 70.97 70.74 75.74\nYi-34B-Chat-4bits(AWQ) 65.77 72.42 78.21 80.50 75.71 77.27 61.84 48.30 69.39 70.51 74.00\nWe evaluated various benchmarks using both zero-shot and few-shot methods, except for TruthfulQA. Generally, the zero-shot approach is more common in chat models. Our evaluation strategy involves generating responses while following instructions explicitly or implicitly (such as using few-shot examples). We then isolate relevant answers from the generated text. Some models are not well-suited to produce output in the specific format required by instructions in few datasets, which leads to suboptimal results.\n*: C-Eval results are evaluated on the validation datasets\n📊 Quantized chat model performance\nWe also provide both 4-bit (AWQ) and 8-bit (GPTQ) quantized Yi chat models. Evaluation results on various benchmarks have shown that the quantized models have negligible losses. Additionally, they reduce the memory footprint size. After testing different configurations of prompts and generation lengths, we highly recommend following the guidelines in the memory footprint table below when selecting a device to run our models.\nbatch=1 batch=4 batch=16 batch=32\nYi-34B-Chat 65GiB 68GiB 76GiB >80GiB\nYi-34B-Chat-8bits(GPTQ) 35GiB 37GiB 46GiB 58GiB\nYi-34B-Chat-4bits(AWQ) 19GiB 20GiB 30GiB 40GiB\nYi-6B-Chat 12GiB 13GiB 15GiB 18GiB\nYi-6B-Chat-8bits(GPTQ) 7GiB 8GiB 10GiB 14GiB\nYi-6B-Chat-4bits(AWQ) 4GiB 5GiB 7GiB 10GiB\nNote: All the numbers in the table represent the minimum recommended memory for running models of the corresponding size.\n⛔️ Limitations of chat model\nThe released chat model has undergone exclusive training using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Compared to other standard chat models, our model produces more diverse responses, making it suitable for various downstream tasks, such as creative scenarios. Furthermore, this diversity is expected to enhance the likelihood of generating higher quality responses, which will be advantageous for subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) training.\nHowever, this higher diversity might amplify certain existing issues, including:\nHallucination: This refers to the model generating factually incorrect or nonsensical information. With the model's responses being more varied, there's a higher chance of hallucination that are not based on accurate data or logical reasoning.\nNon-determinism in re-generation: When attempting to regenerate or sample responses, inconsistencies in the outcomes may occur. The increased diversity can lead to varying results even under similar input conditions.\nCumulative Error: This occurs when errors in the model's responses compound over time. As the model generates more diverse responses, the likelihood of small inaccuracies building up into larger errors increases, especially in complex tasks like extended reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, etc.\nTo achieve more coherent and consistent responses, it is advisable to adjust generation configuration parameters such astemperature,top_p, ortop_k. These adjustments can help in the balance between creativity and coherence in the model's outputs.\n[ Back to top ⬆️ ]\n🟢 Who can use Yi?\nEveryone! 🙌 ✅\nThe Yi series models are free for personal usage, academic purposes, and commercial use.

The Mixtral-8x7B outperforms Llama 2 70B on most benchmarks we tested.\nFor full details of this model please read our release blog post.\nWarning\nThis repo contains weights that are compatible with vLLM serving of the model as well as Hugging Face transformers library. It is based on the original Mixtral torrent release, but the file format and parameter names are different. Please note that model cannot (yet) be instantiated with HF.\nInstruction format\nThis format must be strictly respected, otherwise the model will generate sub-optimal outputs.\nThe template used to build a prompt for the Instruct model is defined as follows:\n<s> [INST] Instruction [/INST] Model answer</s> [INST] Follow-up instruction [/INST]\nNote that <s> and </s> are special tokens for beginning of string (BOS) and end of string (EOS) while [INST] and [/INST] are regular strings.\nAs reference, here is the pseudo-code used to tokenize instructions during fine-tuning:\ndef tokenize(text):\n    return tok.encode(text, add_special_tokens=False)\n\n[BOS_ID] + \ntokenize(\"[INST]\") + tokenize(USER_MESSAGE_1) + tokenize(\"[/INST]\") +\ntokenize(BOT_MESSAGE_1) + [EOS_ID] +\n…\ntokenize(\"[INST]\") + tokenize(USER_MESSAGE_N) + tokenize(\"[/INST]\") +\ntokenize(BOT_MESSAGE_N) + [EOS_ID]\nIn the pseudo-code above, note that the tokenize method should not add a BOS or EOS token automatically, but should add a prefix space.\nRun the model\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_id = \"mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)\n\ntext = \"Hello my name is\"\ninputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=20)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\nBy default, transformers will load the model in full precision. Therefore you might be interested to further reduce down the memory requirements to run the model through the optimizations we offer in HF ecosystem:\nIn half-precision\nNote float16 precision only works on GPU devices\nClick to expand\nLower precision using (8-bit & 4-bit) using bitsandbytes\nClick to expand\nLoad the model with Flash Attention 2\nClick to expand\nLimitations\nThe Mixtral-8x7B Instruct model is a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance. It does not have any moderation mechanisms.

Recent studies have examined GRE activity and the effects of genetic variants on transcript efficiency and their contribution to susceptibility to behavioral disorders. Epigenetic changes and environmental factors can influence the effects of these allele-specific variants, impacting the response to GCs of the FKBP5 gene. The main epigenetic mark investigated in FKBP5 intronic regions is DNA methylation, however, few studies have been performed for all GRES located in these regions. One of the major findings was the association of low DNA methylation levels in the intron 7 of FKBP5 in patients with psychiatric disorders. To date, there are no reports of DNA methylation in introns 2 and 5 of the gene associated with diagnoses of psychiatric disorders.

However, with careful planning and execution, it can be accomplished. Here's a detailed guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Acquiring Dolphins**: Finding dolphins isn't easy, but you could potentially find them in the wild or at aquariums. For ethical reasons, we suggest acquiring adult dolphins that have been born into captivity. They may not have had as much exposure to humans as their wild counterparts, which makes them easier to handle.\n\n2. **Creating a Safe Environment**: Build a large pool or enclosure where these dolphins can live comfortably while you train them. It should mimic their natural environment as closely as possible. Include elements like rocks (for resting), seaweed (for hiding), and water currents (to simulate ocean conditions).\n\n3. **Training Sessions**: Begin by teaching basic commands such as \"come\", \"stay\", \"sit\", \"roll over\". Use positive reinforcement methods like treats and praise to encourage good behavior. Be patient; dolphins are intelligent creatures who need time to understand what they're being asked to do.\n\n4. **Transportation Training**: Once your dolphins have mastered basic commands, start integrating travel into the mix. Place floating objects around the pool to represent different destinations. The goal here would be to get your dolphins to recognize these items and associate them with specific locations. Start with short trips and gradually increase the distance.\n\n5. **Protection Skills**: To teach them protective skills, introduce simulated threats into the pool. This might involve using inflatable obstacles or having another trained animal pretend to attack. The dolphins will learn to react appropriately to these situations.\n\n6. **Fishing Skills**: Teaching dolphins to catch fish involves introducing nets or toys into the pool and encouraging them to use their mouths to retrieve the object. Reward them when they successfully catch something.\n\n7. **Socialization**: Dolphins thrive in social environments so ensure they spend plenty of time interacting with each other during their training sessions. This can help reduce stress levels and make training more effective.\n\n8. **Dietary Needs**: Dolphins require a diet high in protein, fats, and minerals. Feed them fish rich in these nutrients several times per day. If necessary, consult with a marine biologist or veterinarian experienced in aquatic diets for advice.\nGratitude\nThis model was made possible by the generous sponsorship of Convai.\nHuge thank you to Microsoft for training and publishing the weights of Phi-2\nThank you to Microsoft for authoring the Orca paper and inspiring this work.\nHUGE Thank you to the dataset authors: @jondurbin, @ise-uiuc, @teknium, @LDJnr and @migtissera\nAnd HUGE thanks to @winglian and the Axolotl contributors for making the best training framework!\nThank you to all the other people in the Open Source AI community who have taught me and helped me along the way.\nExample Output\nFuture Plans\nDolphin 3.0 dataset is in progress, and will include:\nenhanced general chat use-cases\nenhanced structured output\nenhanced Agent cases like Autogen, Memgpt, Functions\nenhanced role-playing\nIf you would like to financially support my efforts\nswag",

Direct preference optimization (DPO) is used for fine-tuning on a 10k subset of the UltraFeedback dataset.\nThe purpose of the experiment is to understand the quality of the pre-trained Phi-2 model. The good news is that phi-2-dpo can follow open-ended user instructions well.\nDecoding\nFormat your prompt as\n\"\"\"### Human: {instruction}\n\n### Assistant:\"\"\"\nwhere instruction is your query.\nHere's a full-fledged example:\nimport torch\nimport transformers\n\nmodel: transformers.PreTrainedModel = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    \"lxuechen/phi-2-dpo\",\n    low_cpu_mem_usage=True,\n    device_map=\"auto\",\n    trust_remote_code=True,\n    torch_dtype=torch.float16\n)\ntokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path)\n\ninput_text = \"### Human: Give me a good recipe for a chinese dish\\n\\n### Assistant:\"\n\noutputs = model.generate(\n    tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)['input_ids'],\n    max_length=1024,\n    temperature=0.7,\n    top_p=0.9,\n    do_sample=True,\n    pad_token_id=tokenizer.pad_token_id,\n    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,\n    max_new_tokens=1024\n)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\nTraining\nThe model was fine-tuned on a 10k subset of the binarized version of UltraFeedback with DPO.\nHyperparameters:\nlearning rate: 3% linear warmup, with a peak of 3e-5 and cosine decay\nepochs: 2\nbatch size: 64\ncontext length: 1024\nDPO beta: 0.1\nLimitations of phi-2-dpo\nGenerate Inaccurate Code and Facts: The model may produce incorrect code snippets and statements. Users should treat these outputs as suggestions or starting points, not as definitive or accurate solutions.\nLimited Scope for code: Majority of Phi-2 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\nUnreliable Responses to Instruction: The model has not undergone instruction fine-tuning. As a result, it may struggle or fail to adhere to intricate or nuanced instructions provided by users.\nLanguage Limitations: The model is primarily designed to understand standard English. Informal English, slang, or any other languages might pose challenges to its comprehension, leading to potential misinterpretations or errors in response.\nPotential Societal Biases: Phi-2 is not entirely free from societal biases despite efforts in assuring trainig data safety. There's a possibility it may generate content that mirrors these societal biases, particularly if prompted or instructed to do so. We urge users to be aware of this and to exercise caution and critical thinking when interpreting model outputs.\nToxicity: Despite being trained with carefully selected data, the model can still produce harmful content if explicitly prompted or instructed to do so. We chose to release the model for research purposes only -- We hope to help the open-source community develop the most effective ways to reduce the toxicity of a model directly after pretraining.\nVerbosity: Phi-2 being a base model often produces irrelevant or extra text and responses following its first answer to user prompts within a single turn. This is due to its training dataset being primarily textbooks, which results in textbook-like responses.",

The method works by posing the sequence to be classified as the NLI premise and to construct a hypothesis from each candidate label. For example, if we want to evaluate whether a sequence belongs to the class \"politics\", we could construct a hypothesis of This text is about politics.. The probabilities for entailment and contradiction are then converted to label probabilities.\nThis method is surprisingly effective in many cases, particularly when used with larger pre-trained models like BART and Roberta.

The image encoder was initialized from the weights of BEiT, while the text decoder was initialized from the weights of RoBERTa.\nImages are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.
